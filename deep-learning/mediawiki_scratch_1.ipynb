      "[[File:EnglandDevon.png|right|framed|A [[map]] showing where Devon is in England (coloured [[red]])]]\n",
      "'''Devon''' is a [[county]] in southwest [[England]]. Sometimes, it is called ''Devonshire'' although this is not its correct name. Devon is the second largest county in England, and has the longest road network of any county in England.\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "After the last [[ice age]], Devon was one of the first places in England where people started to live. [[Archaeologist]]s have found many old places in Devon with [[wikt:ancient|ancient]] buildings. For example, many ruins of old buildings have been found in an area called \"[[Dartmoor]]\", which is now a [[National Park]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Devon gets its name from the ''Dumnonii'', a name that the invading [[Roman Britain|Romans]] gave to the Celtic tribe in that area. The Romans invaded Devon about [[AD]] 50. The name ''Dumnonii'' means \"a person who lives in a deep [[valley]]\", and it comes from the [[hill]]s and valleys of the area. The Roman [[army]] stayed in Devon for about 25 years. Their [[military base|base]] was in the city of [[Exeter]].\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long time before anyone else invaded Devon. [[Saxons]] came to Devon in the [[7th century]], and the King of [[Wessex]] may have attacked in [[614]]. There was a conflict between Devon and Wessex for 200 years. Some [[historian]]s think that Wessex won the war by about [[715]] but others think this did not happen until at least [[936]]. Eventually Wessex took control, but the Kings of Devon still had some power.\n",
      "\n",
      "A person living at the time called [[William of Malmesbury]] said that in Exeter both Britons and Saxons were equal in [[927]] but that King Athelstan of Wessex then chased the Britons from Exeter. From place names and church dedications it seems that the British did not go far and later came back into Exeter because an area in the city was called \"Britayne\" until recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large number of Devon placenames include (or are) the word \"combe\" (e.g. [[Ilfracombe]]). This word comes from the [[Brythonic]] (Celtic) language and is like the Welsh word \"cwm\". Another typical Devon word is \"tor\" which is also Brythonic, and like the Welsh word \"twr\".\n",
      "Both of these words are often found in neighbouring counties, but Devon has the greatest number. Overall Devon has a number of other placenames that are Brythonic and others that come from [[Old English]], and a few that come from [[Norse]]. Devon's placenames are like those of western [[Somerset]] and eastern [[Cornwall]] which was also part of the old kingdom of \"Dumnonia\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in the [[9th century]], groups of [[Viking]] [[raider]]s tried to invade Devon. This continued until the [[Norman Conquest]]. The name of ''[[Lundy]] Island'' comes from the Viking [[language]], which was called [[Norse]]. The Vikings are remembered for moving the [[cathedral]] from [[Crediton]] to [[Exeter]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Devon has been involved in most of the civil [[conflict]]s in England since [[1066]]:\n",
      "* During the Norman Conquest of England, Exeter was surrounded by [[William the Conqueror]]'s army for 18 days.\n",
      "* In [[1140]], the towns of Exeter and [[Plympton]] were both defended against [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]].\n",
      "* There were small battles in Devon during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n",
      "* The army of [[Perkin Warbeck]] surrounded and attacked Exeter in [[1497]].\n",
      "* The [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549: rebels from Cornwall and Devon marched towards London.\n",
      "* The towns of Exeter and [[Dartmouth]] were both [[siege|besieged]] (surrounded by the enemy) during the [[English Civil War]].\n",
      "* When [[William of Orange]] invaded Britain in [[1688]] (the ''[[Glorious Revolution]]''), he landed at [[Brixham]].\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many [[celebrity|famous]] (well known) people from Devon, especially [[seaman|seamen]]. For example, Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir [[Richard Grenville]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] all come from Devon. Many other famous people were also born in Devon: for example, the author [[Agatha Christie]] was born in the town of [[Torquay]].\n",

      "\n",
      "Devon has its own [[flag]]. It is linked to [[St Petroc]], who is a local [[Canonization|saint]] with links to Devon and nearby counties. The flag was chosen after winning a [[competition]] on the [[BBC]] Devon [[website]] in [[2003]].\n",
      "\n",
      "== Economy ==\n",
      "Devon is less wealthy than many parts of England, for example the south east. This is because the traditional [[industry|industries]] of Devon, for example [[fishing]], [[mining]] and [[farming]] are declining. The [[European Union]] has given parts of Devon help ([[Objective 2]]). For example, [[grant]]s of money have been given to help new industries grow. [[Tourism]] has become more important recently as a part of the economy of Devon.\n",
      "\n",
      "An [[epidemic]] of [[Foot and Mouth disease]] in [[2001]] led to many [[farmer]]s losing their [[cattle]], so they lost a lot of money. Other industries also lost a lot of [[income]] because of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "== Politics ==\n",
      "The main city of Devon is [[Plymouth, Devon|Plymouth]]. Exeter is where the county [[council]] is based. The county of Devon is split up into [[district]]s. Each district is run by a [[district council]]. Some things are the job of the county council and others are the job of the district council. There are also smaller [[town]] and [[parish]] councils inside the districts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plymouth and [[Torbay]] are not run by the county council, but have their own special councils. These councils do the jobs of both a county and a district council. These type of areas are called ''[[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]''.\n",
