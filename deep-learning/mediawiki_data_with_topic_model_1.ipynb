Erik also got into some trouble in Iceland, and was exiled in 982. Erik had heard of the travels of Gunnbjörn Ulfsson, who discovered some islands west of Iceland. Erik decided to explore these islands, and found land at a place he named Midjökull. But the weather there was very harsh, so Erik left and continued south, reaching land again at an island he named Erik’s Island. Erik spent his winter, as well as the following one, at Erik’s Island. Erik was no longer exiled from Iceland, so he returned the summer of 985. But when the fights with his neighbors began again, Erik decided to start advertising his new found land. He called his land {{10}}, to make it sound nicer than it actually was. \\n\\nHe left Iceland in 986 with 25 ships, but only 14 survived the journey, with about 400-500 people and animals. The ships settled at Brattahlid. There were two established settlements; the Eastern Settlement on the coast on the southwest, and the Western Settlement 300 miles above that Settlement. He lived in the colony in Eriksfjord, and was the chief leader of both settlements. The people that lived in the settlements farmed land, raised animals like cows, pigs, and lamb, and hunted many animals. Erik’s wife Thjodhild became a believer in Christ, and she built the initial church in Greenland. However, Eric didn’t convert to Christianity. \\n\\nLater, he wanted to go on an expedition west of Greenland, in search of land. He did not go because he fell off his horse, and saw this as a symbol of bad luck. In around 1000, {{11}}, his son conducted what was most likely the first trip made to the North American mainland.',\n",

A visitor to Charleston commented “Charleston looks more like a Negro country than a country settled by white people”.  \\n\\nSoutherners feared a slave rebellion like the one on {{21}} only a few {{22}}s earlier. They also feared that without slaves their {{23}} would collapse completely. Slavery had become a subject of vital interest to everyone in the United States. In 1859, {{24}} on the federal arsenal at Harper\\'s Ferry, Virginia by the abolitionist {{26}} shocked the south. Had Brown succeeded, he intended to arm slaves in the south with {{27}}s to {{28}} against their masters. Each new state admitted to the United States became a battle over whether it would be a free state or would allow slavery. {{29}} from all sides flocked to {{30}} to promote their own cause. {{31}} became a worst case {{32}} where the competing views broke down into outright {{33}}. Political compromises were tried, such as the {{34}} of 1820 and the {{35}}. But nothing short of outright {{36}} would settle the issue.\\n\\nSlaves were generally poorly fed and had minimal {{37}} and places to sleep. Household servants usually did better as they got the old clothes of their master\\'s family and had access to better quality {{38}}. Slaves suffered from poor {{39}} in the {{40}} and {{41}} of the south. Because of their poor diet and {{42}} living conditions, they frequently suffered from {{43}}s. The {{44}} plantations were the most deadly for slaves. They stood in water for most of the day under the hot {{45}}. {{46}} was a common disease. The {{47}} was highest among slave children. It averaged about 66 {{48}} generally and was as high as 90 % on rice plantations.\\n\\nSlave women were frequently used for sex by their masters. If any refused they were {{50}}. Their {{51}} mixed or {{52}} children were considered slaves because their status followed that of the mother. All women in the south, black or white, were considered chattel or property, they belonged to the master. In 1808, the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves took effect. After this time slave {{54}} by their masters became a common way to produce slaves. There was also a demand for light-skinned, good looking young female slaves. These \"fancy maids\", slave women sold at auction as {{55}}s or {{56}}s, brought the highest prices. \\n\\nThe arguments for slavery by Southern {{57}} said that chattel slavery (slaves as property), as practiced in the South, was more humane than the system of \"wage slavery\" practiced in the {{59}} {{60}}. George Fitzhugh, in his book published in 1857, Cannibals All!, maintained that pro-slavery held the {{61}} in the national {{62}} over slavery. Fitzhugh maintained that because slaveholders owned their slaves they took better care of them than the northern {{63}}s who only \"rented\" their workers.\\n\\nSome pointed out that slave owners provided food and clothes for their slaves, something that northern employers did not do. Other arguments pointed out that in addition to the benefits slaves enjoyed under slavery that by keeping them separate, they did not mix with the white race. While this was a fear of many southerners, the argument played on the fears of northerners. The basis for this was the commonly held {{64}} at the time that blacks were inferior to whites.\\n\\nOthers pointed out that a sudden end to slavery would cause economic collapse in the south. There would be no {{65}}, {{66}} or rice industries. Also, that if all the slaves were freed it would lead to {{67}} and chaos all over the United States. They claimed it would lead to uprisings much like the \"Reign of Terror\" during the French Revolution.  \\n\\nThese arguments and others were widely published in {{69}}s, {{70}}s and {{71}}s. They were carefully designed to promote and defend slavery.',\n",

The three main substances that pollute water are {{31}}s from {{32}}s, sewage and {{33}}s.\\n\\nActivities such as bathing and washing clothes near lakes, ponds or rivers add nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous into the water bodies.This leads to excessive growth of {{34}} on the surface of water. It blocks the penetration of sunlight and air, thus reducing oxygen.\\n\\nIt causes  harm to organisms living in water and can also harm people's health. In extreme cases it may cause problems such as {{35}}.\\n\\nNoise pollution also known as sound pollution which is harmful to the brain and hearing of all animals and humans. This includes the sound of vehicles, loud speakers, airplanes, jets, train horns etc. Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness, especially to older people. It causes brain related problems too.\\n\\nSoil pollution (also known as land pollution) is caused when man-made chemicals, such as hydrocarbons, heavy metals, solvents, get into the soil.These chemicals come from industrial activities and from {{36}} disposal in leaky landfills. Soil pollution may cause health risks. The chemicals can produce harmful vapours, or they can contaminate water supplies underneath the polluted soil.\\n\\nPlastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic products in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans.It takes thousands of years to dissolve or mix in earth.It was so dangerous using plastic.\\n\\nA common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers.

First, the {{7}} (the bottom part of the uterus) is dilated, or made bigger. This is often done about a day before the actual procedure. To dilate the cervix, a {{8}} may put special tools into the cervix. The cervix needs to be made larger so that medical tools, like forceps (surgical tongs) or a curette (a tool that is used to scrape away the {{10}}) can be put into the cervix.\\n\\nThe second step of the D&E procedure is to evacuate, or remove, everything inside of the uterus. The woman is given a local {{11}} to numb part of her body or a general anesthetic to put her to sleep. The doctor will then put a cannula (a medical tube) into the uterus, through the {{13}}. The cannula is attached to a bottle and a pump that create a {{14}}. The cannula is used to vacuum (or suction) out everything that is in the uterus, including the {{15}}. The doctor may use forceps to take out any tissue that is still in the uterus. The doctor may also use a curette to scrape out the lining of the uterus. The vacuum can then be used again to make sure that the uterus is completely empty. This is to prevent infection from tissue left behind by accident.\\n\\nIf a woman is earlier on in her pregnancy, this procedure can sometimes be done without dilating the cervix first. This is called a \"vacuum aspiration\". It can be used for women who are in the first trimester (the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) or for women who are in the early stages of the second trimester. However, sometime during the second trimester, it becomes very difficult to do this procedure without dilating the cervix first. At this point, a full dilation and extraction is needed.\\n\\nA complete D&E usually takes 10 to 20 minutes.  Often, women are able to go home on the same day as the procedure, without staying overnight in a {{17}}.\\n\\nMost abortions are done much earlier on in the pregnancy, so a full dilation and extraction is usually not needed.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Plain White T\\'s are an {{0}} {{1}} from {{2}}. Their newest release, Every Second Counts ({{3}}), was the first Plain White T\\'s {{4}} to reach the {{5}}. When the album came out, one {{6}}, Hey There Delilah, an {{7}} love song, was played on many {{8}}s daily. Another famous song of theirs is Our Time Now.\\n\\nThe singer of the band, Tom Higgenson, first wanted to be a drummer. He was in many bands during his High School. However, when Plain White T\\'s were made, he decided to become a singer and a songwriter. Bassist, Ken Fletcher, and drummer, Dave Tirio, joined the band began performing in Downers Grove, Illinois.\\n\\nThey started out by playing other people\\'s songs, but in the summer of 1999 the band was beginning to become known by record labels like Atlantic Recordings. In 2000 they released their first album, \"Come On Over\". They toured around Chicago to try and make the album sell more and to get more fans.\\n\\nAt the end of 2001, Plain White T\\'s left Atlantic Recordings and signed to Fearless Records. They began recording for their next album, called \"Stop\". They chose in Downers Grove, Illinois and Santa Barbara, California. The album took four months to record, being finished in April 2002. The album was shown around Plain White T\\'s home town before being released finally on August 20th 2002, a whole twenty months after it was started.\\n\\nIn {{9}}, the band went on their first big tour. The tour in the band ending up stopping being friends, this was solved with new members, with Dave switching from drums to guitar, Steve being replaced by Tim Lopez, Ken being replaced by Mike Retondo and De\\'Mar Hamilton taking up drums.\\n\\nThe band went into the studio to record their next album, called \"All That We Needed\",in May 2004. After recording the album, they toured the US. During this tour, they released their first single, All That We Needed. They then promoted the album internationally, gathering a growing fanbase, before heading back for the 2005 Take Action Tour.\\n\\nDuring the \"Take Action Tour \\'05\", Plain White T\\'s recorded their first music video with a single which they hoped would be more famous than \"All That We Needed\" .\\n\\nIn 2006 they signed to another new label, Hollywood Records, and then began recording a new album. Shortly before the release of the album, the single \"Hate (I Really Don\\'t Like You)\" was released, it was the first single by them to achieve noticeable success.\\n\\nPlain White T\\'s started touring in Winter and Autumn of 2006. By this time they were starting to get noticed in the music industry at last. Although they were beginning to get noticed in the minor US rock industry, internationally Plain White Ts were not doing so well, by this point, they had not even sold 100,000 copies of any album anywhere outside of the US. Hollywood Records thought that re-releasing \"Hey There Delilah\" would make the band famous.\\n\\n\"Hey There Delilah\" is an {{10}} song, first released as a {{11}} in {{12}} {{13}} as chasing cars, and was the last track in the band\\'s first album, All That We Needed. One year later, in {{15}}, the song became the band\\'s first mainstream hit. On {{16}} {{17}}, the song reached number one for sales in the Billboard Hot 100. One month later, the song became a hit single all over the world. Hey There Delilah reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and Ireland Singles Chart, number four in the Australian chart and number six in the United World Chart. Its popularity made it to #1 in other countries like Germany and Canada.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Algae (one alga, but several algae) are a type of {{0}}-like living things that can make food from sunlight by {{1}}. The study of algae is called {{2}} or {{3}}.\\n\\nThe term lumps together many different kinds of organisms. They have in common  only that they are {{4}}ic: they use natural sources of energy and simple inorganic materials to build their forms. As {{5}}s they do not have the kind of {{6}} and {{7}} structure of {{8}}. They are a convenient but very loose term. Only in recent years has it become clear how different the many kinds of algae are.\\n\\nAlgae are a large and diverse group of simple, typically {{9}}ic organisms. Some have {{10}} and others have {{11}}. The largest and most complex marine algae are called {{12}}s. They are like {{13}}s, and \"simple\" because they lack the many distinct organs found in land plants. For that reason they are not classified as plants.\\n\\nThough the {{14}} {{15}} (formerly referred to as blue-green algae) were included as \"algae\" in older textbooks, it is not now. The term algae is now used for {{16}} organisms. All true algae have a nucleus within a {{17}} and {{18}}s inside one or more membranes. However, algae are definitely not a {{19}} group, as they do not all descend from a common algal ancestor. Modern {{20}} propose splitting them up into monophyletic groups, but not everyone agrees how to do this.\\n\\nAlgae do not have the same structures that land plants do, such as {{21}}, {{22}}s, and other {{23}}.  Nearly all algae have parts that do photosynthesis the same way as cyanobacteria.  They make {{24}}, unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green bacteria.  Some unicellular {{25}} use only external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic parts.\\n\\nFossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.\\n\\nAlgae are usually found in damp places or water, and are common on land and water. However, algae on land are usually inconspicuous and are far more common in moist, {{26}} {{27}}s than dry ones. Algae do not have vascular tissues and other adaptations to live on land, but they can endure dryness and other conditions in {{28}} with a {{29}} as {{30}}.\\n\\nThe various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic {{31}}. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column are called {{32}}. They provide the food base for most {{33}} {{34}}s. Kelp grows mostly in shallow marine waters. Some are used as human food or harvested for {{35}} or {{36}}. Kelp can grow in large stands called kelp forests. These forests prevent some of the damage from waves. Many different {{37}} live in them, including {{38}}s, sea {{39}}s, and {{40}}.\\n\\nSome algae may harm other species. Some algae may reproduce a lot, and make an algal bloom. These algae may make protective {{41}}s which can kill fish in the water. {{42}}s make a compound that turns the flesh of fish into slime. Then the algae eats this nutritious liquid.\\n\\n \\nAlgae have evolved a number of {{43}} partnerships with other organisms. The most famous is the plant-like {{44}}, which are each formed by a {{45}} with an alga. It is a highly successful life-form, and twenty thousand \\'species\\' are known. In all cases the lichen are quite different in appearance and life-style from either constituent; it is possibly the most complete symbiosis known. Both constituents gain from their access to {{46}}s with low nutrient value, which is where lichen are found.\\n\\nLess well known are the algal relationships with animals. {{47}}-building {{48}}s are basically social {{49}}n {{50}}s. Corals are dependent on light, because the algae are important partners, and they require light. Corals have evolved structures, often tree-like, which offer the algae maximum access to light. The coral weakens the algal cell walls, and digests about 80% of the food synthesised by the algae. The corals\\' waste-products provide {{51}}s for the algae so, as with lichen, both partners gain from the association. The algae are golden-brown {{52}} algae, often of the genus Symbiodinium. A curious feature of the partnership is that the coral may eject the algae in hard times, and regain them later. The ejection of the algal partner is called bleaching, because the coral loses its colour.\\n\\nVarious other marine {{53}} groups have members which symbiose with algae. {{54}}s (Platyhelminths) and {{55}} worms (Annelids) are two such groups.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Modern paper is a thin {{0}} of (mostly) {{1}}s pressed together. People write on paper, and {{2}}s are made of paper. Paper can absorb {{3}}s such as {{4}}, so people can clean things with paper.\\n\\nThe pulp and paper industry comprises companies that use wood as raw material and produce {{5}}, paper, board and other cellulose-based products.\\n\\nModern paper is normally made from {{6}} pulp. Wood is ground up and mixed with {{7}} and other {{8}}s to make a thin liquid called \"paper pulp\". Paper pulp can be {{9}} to make paper more white, and {{10}}s can be added to make colored paper. This pulp is pressed into sheets of paper. Printing is often done on paper before the paper is cut into sheets. Newsprint paper (newspaper) comes in a huge roll, and goes through the printing process as one continuous sheet. It is cut by a machine-driven {{11}} blade later. Folding comes last, then packing for distribution. \\n\\nSometimes paper is made heavier and more glossy (shiny) by adding {{12}}, and by \\'milling\\' it. Milling is done by squeezing the paper through a series of rollers. Sometimes paper is made from used or waste paper: this is {{13}}.\\n\\nNot all paper is made from wood. Other kinds of fiber can be used. People still make paper from {{14}}, {{15}} and {{16}} for special purposes.\\n\\n{{17}} started long before the invention of paper. People wrote on many kinds of material. They wrote on cloth, on stone walls, on wood. In {{18}} the {{19}}ians wrote on {{20}} tablets, many of which have survived today. In Europe, people wrote on {{21}}.\\n\\nMany {{22}} ago – as early as the {{23}} (that\\'s over 2000 BC) – people in {{24}} made a kind of paper from the {{25}} plant. This is where the word \\'paper\\' comes from. The people of {{26}} and {{27}} learned to do this too. The Romans wrote on {{28}} (made from animal skin), on {{29}}ed tablets and on wood (see {{30}}).\\n\\nIn {{31}} 105 AD, the {{32}} {{33}} told his Emperor he had made paper. They had previously used {{34}} and {{35}}. The material used in this ancient paper included {{36}} rags, {{37}}, various plant fibres and old {{38}}. The oldest existing paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a watchtower in the Great Wall of China. It dates to about 150 AD. Even earlier paper (but with no writing on it) has been claimed: \"The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world is made of hemp fibers, discovered in 1957 in a tomb near Xian, China, and dates from between the years 140 and 87 BC\". Paper-making was regarded by the Chinese as so valuable that they kept it secret as long as they could.\\n\\nPeople in {{40}} learned how to make paper with fibres of the {{41}} tree, around 610 AD. This is called Japanese paper or Washi. The Chinese invention spread to India, and then to the Middle East, and then to {{45}}.\\n\\nAn opportunity occurred after The Battle of Talas in 751. Then an {{46}} army captured soldiers of the Chinese. There were some paper makers among the captured soldiers. From them, paper-making spread throughout the {{47}}.  In 757, a paper mill was built at {{48}}. People learned to use {{49}} as paper raw material and to use starch made from {{50}} as an additive.\\n\\nThe {{51}} used {{52}} and {{53}} rags. In 1276 the first Italian paper mill was built at Fabriano and, until the 14 century, Italy was a paper supplier in Europe. In 1282 the first watermark was introduced in {{56}}.\\n\\nPaper was hard to make. It was cheaper than the old writing materials, but still expensive. A mechanical paper maker was conceived in {{57}} 1798, but invented in {{58}}. At least one {{59}} was using them by 1812. Now the process was cheaper but the {{60}} was still expensive.\\n\\nIn 1840 Friedrich Gottlob Keller Invented a machine that could make pulp for paper out of {{61}} fibres (instead of the expensive rag paper). Paper became cheap enough for everyone to buy. Around the same time, other {{62}}s were made, like the {{63}}, the fountain pen, and a {{65}} that used {{66}}. With this new {{67}}, people wrote more letters, made more books and {{68}}s, and kept more records of what they did.\\n\\nToday, some of the largest paper-producing countries are {{69}}, {{70}}, {{71}}, {{72}}, {{73}} and {{74}}. Paper is produced in large factories called paper mills. They produce hundreds of thousands of tons of paper each year.\\n\\nPaper is used for {{75}} and printing. Books, {{76}}s and {{77}}s are printed on paper.\\n\\nPaper is often used for {{78}}. Paper used for money is often made in very special ways, to make it hard for people to print their own money. A piece of paper money is called a {{79}}, a bill or a note.\\n\\nPaper can be used for cleaning. Special forms of paper are used, such as {{80}}s, facial tissues or {{82}}.\\n\\nPretty paper can be used as decoration. It can be pasted onto the walls of a room; this is called {{84}}. Paper can be used to wrap gifts. This is called {{85}} or gift wrap.\\n\\nSome kinds of paper are strong and can be used in {{87}}es and other {{88}} {{89}}.

       "  'text': 'Saffron () (Persian: زَعْفَرَان) is a {{0}} made from the {{1}} of the {{2}} of the saffron plant. The spice is used in cooking as a {{3}} and as a {{4}}. It is native to {{5}}. It is the world\\'s most costly spice, and has been for a long time.\\n\\nSaffron has a bitter {{6}} and smells like {{7}}. This {{8}} is caused by the {{9}}s picrocrocin and safranal. Saffron also contains a {{12}}, {{13}}, that gives food a rich golden colour. Saffron is a part of many foods from around the world, and is also used in {{14}}.\\n\\nThe word saffron comes from the {{15}} {{16}} word , which comes from the {{17}} word .  is also related to the Italian  and Spanish . Safranum comes from the Arabic word  (), which means \"{{21}}\".\\n\\nThe {{22}} saffron (saffron crocus C. sativus) flowers in the autumn and comes up every year, so it is known as a {{23}}. It does not grow wild, and is now a {{24}} form of the eastern Mediterranean plant called Crocus cartwrightianus. It is thought that C. cartwrightianus came from {{27}}. The saffron crocus resulted when C. cartwrightianus was subjected to a lot of {{28}} by growers who wanted plants with longer stigmas. It can not {{29}} because the saffron crocus\\'s purple flowers do not produce useful seeds. This means that {{30}} needs human help. The {{31}}s (underground bulb-like {{32}}-storing organs) must be dug up, broken apart, and planted again. A corm lives for only one season, reproducing by splitting into up to ten \"cormlets\" that will grow into new plants. The corms are small brown balls up to  in diameter and are covered in thick parallel fibres.\\n\\nAfter a period in summer known as \"{{33}}\", some narrow green leaves come up from the ground. These can grow to up to  in length. The number of leaves is between five and eleven. In autumn, purple buds appear. In October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, the saffron grows its brightly-coloured flowers, which are coloured from light to dark {{34}}. At the time of flowering, the plant is usually less than  in height. Inside each flower are three prongs, called the \"style\". Each prong has a {{36}} \"stigma\" of between 25 and 30 {{37}} in length at the end of it.\\n\\nThe saffron crocus grows best in climates like that of the Mediterranean maquis or the {{39}}n {{40}}, where hot, dry summer winds blow across the land. However, saffron can live through temperatures as cold as , and short periods of snow. Saffron needs no extra water if it grows in a wet place like {{41}}, where there is usually 1000–1500 mm of rain each year. It is also important for the rain to fall at the right time of year: there should be a lot of rain in the {{42}} and little in the {{43}}. Rainfall just before flowering also makes the plant give more saffron. Rainy or cold weather during flowering can cause disease, so the plant gives less saffron. Other things that can make the plant give less saffron are: the weather being damp or hot for a long time; rabbits, rats, and birds, digging in the ground near the plant; {{44}}s such as the {{45}}; {{46}} and corm rot. Saffron plants grow best in strong and direct sunlight. Planting is best done in fields that slope towards the sunlight (i.e. south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere), giving the crocuses\\' more sunlight. In the Northern Hemisphere, planting is mostly done in June, with corms planted some 7–15 cm deep.\\n\\nGrowers have found that planting corms  deep and in rows spaced 2–3 cm apart makes more threads, whereas planting depths of 8–10 cm makes more flowers and corms. Saffron crocuses grow best in crumbly, moist and well-drained {{49}} soils with high organic content. They are often planted in raised beds, to help with drainage. Farmers often use 20–30 tonnes of {{50}} per {{51}} on the plants before plating the corms The buds do not start to grow until early autumn, then in the middle of autumn the plants begin to flower. Picking the flowers must be done quickly: they flower at dawn, but curl up and die during the day. The flowers of the saffron crocuses only last for one or two weeks. From 150 flowers, the farmer can get about 1 {{52}} of dry saffron threads. To produce 12 g of dried saffron (72 g freshly harvested) would take about 1 kg of flowers (1 lb for 0.2 oz of dried saffron). It can be worked out that from this that one freshly picked flower makes 0.03 g of fresh saffron, or 0.007 g of dried saffron.\\n\\nThe history of saffron growing reaches back more than 3,000 years. The wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called Crocus cartwrightianus. Humans began choosing wild plants that had long \"stigmas\". Gradually, a form of C. cartwrightianus, C. sativus, came into being in the late Bronze Age {{54}}. Experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a {{55}} {{56}} {{57}}n book about {{58}} which was written in the time of {{59}}. There is evidence for the use of saffron in the treatment of about 90 illnesses during the past 4,000 years. \\n\\nThe {{60}} had pictures of saffron in their {{61}}s as long ago as 1500–1600 BC, showing how it could be used as a medicine. Later, Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia, where adventurers hoped to find the world\\'s most valuable saffron. Another legend tells how someone named Crocus was bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus. Ancient Mediterranean peoples–including perfumers in {{63}}, physicians in {{64}}, townspeople in {{65}}, and the Greek hetaerae {{67}}s–used saffron in their {{68}}s, ointments, potpourris, {{70}}s, divine offerings, and medical treatments. \\n\\nIn late {{71}} Egypt, {{72}} used saffron in her baths to make her feel good. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all types of {{73}} ailments. Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such {{74}} cities as {{75}} and Tyre. Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the mithridatium.  Such was the {{80}}\\' love of saffron that Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern {{81}}, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome\\'s fall. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with {{82}} AD {{83}} or with the {{84}} papacy in the 14th century AD.\\n\\nPaints made from saffron were being used for drawing 50,000 years ago. These have been found in the country that is today called {{86}}. Later, people called the {{87}} used wild-growing saffron in their medicines and magical potions. Traders carried saffron for long distances before the 2nd millennium BC. Ancient {{88}} were growing their own type of saffron (Crocus sativus \\'Hausknechtii\\') in Derbena, {{89}}, and {{90}} by the 10th century BC. Sometimes saffron threads were woven into textiles,. They were given as offerings to the gods and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads were also scattered across beds and mixed into hot tea as a way of curing {{91}}. Other people were afraid that the Persians would use saffron as a drug and {{92}}. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his tea, rice, and baths to help heal his battle wounds. Alexander\\'s troops copied their leader\\'s actions and brought the habit of saffron-bathing back to Greece.\\n\\nNo one knows how saffron arrived in {{94}}. Traditional {{95}}i and {{96}} accounts date its arrival anywhere between 900–2500 years ago. Historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime before 500 BC, saying it was either Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks or a Persian invasion and colonization of {{97}}. {{98}}ns then sold Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. From there, saffron use in foods and dyes spread throughout South Asia. For example, {{99}} monks in India started wearing saffron-coloured robes after the {{101}}\\'s death. However, the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but {{102}}, a less expensive dye, or {{103}}.\\n\\nSome historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. On the other hand, saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume Shennong Bencaojing (神農本草經—\"Shennong\\'s Great Herbal\", also known as Pen Ts\\'ao or Pun Tsao) pharmacopoeia, a tome dating from 200–300 BC. Traditionally attributed to the legendary Yan (\"Fire\") Emperor (炎帝) Shennong, it documents 252 phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders. Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. For example, Wan Zhen, a Chinese medical expert, reported that \"[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha.\" Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time: \"The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise {{105}}.\"\\n\\nIn {{106}}, saffron cultivation declined steeply following the Roman Empire\\'s fall. Saffron was reintroduced when the Islamic civilization \"Al-Andalus\" spread to {{107}}, France, and Italy. During the 14th century Black Death, there was a huge increase in demand for saffron-based medicine. Much saffron had to be imported by Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as {{109}}. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen started the 14 week long \"Saffron War\". The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred significant saffron cultivation in {{110}}, which grew prosperous. Cultivation and trade then spread to {{111}}, where epidemic levels of saffron adulteration brought on the Safranschou code. Under this law under saffron adulterers were fined, imprisoned, and executed. Soon after, saffron cultivation spread throughout England, especially {{112}} and {{113}}. The Essex town of {{114}}, named for its new specialty crop, became England\\'s main saffron growing and trading center. However, an influx of more exotic spices such as {{115}}, {{116}}, {{117}}, and {{118}} from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline. Only in southern France, Italy, and Spain, did significant cultivation continue.\\n\\nEuropeans brought saffron to the {{119}} when immigrant members of the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing saffron corms; indeed, many Schwenkfelders had widely grown saffron in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch were growing saffron throughout eastern {{122}}. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron\\'s list price on the {{123}} commodities exchange was set equal to that of {{124}}. The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the {{125}}, when many saffron-transporting merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nSaffron\\'s aroma is often described to be something like metallic honey with {{127}}y or {{128}}-like notes. Its taste has also been noted as hay-like and somewhat bitter. Saffron gives a light yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in Iranian (Persian), Arab, Central Asian, European, Indian,Turkish, Moroccan and {{137}} cuisines. Confectioneries and liquors also often include saffron. Common saffron substitutes include safflower (Carthamus tinctorius, which is often sold as \"Portuguese saffron\" or \"assafroa\") and {{139}} (Curcuma longa). Saffron has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time. Modern medicine has also discovered itas having anticarcinogenic (cancer-suppressing), anti-mutagenic ({{141}}-preventing), immunomodulating, and {{142}}-like properties. Saffron has also been used as a fabric {{143}}, particularly in {{144}} and India, and in perfumery.\\n\\nMost saffron is grown in a belt of land ranging from the Mediterranean in the west to {{147}} in the east. Annually, around 300 tonnes of saffron are produced worldwide. {{148}} ranks first in the world production of saffron, with more than 94 percent of the world yield. Iran\\'s annual saffron production is expected to hit 300 tons by the end of the nation\\'s Fourth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan in 2009. Other minor producers of saffron are {{149}}, India, {{151}}, {{152}}, {{153}}, and {{154}}. A pound of dry saffron (0.45 kg) requires 50,000–75,000 flowers. These flowers would need about a football field\\'s area of cultivation. Some forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers. Upon extraction, stigmas are dried quickly and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers. Saffron prices at wholesale and retail rates range from US$500/pound to US$5,000/pound (US$1100–US$11,000 per kilogram)—equivalent to £250/€350 per pound or £5,500/€7,500 per kilo. In Western countries, the average retail price is $1,000/£500/€700 per pound (US$2200/£1100/€1550 per kilogram). A pound comprises between 70,000 and 200,000 threads. Vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, elasticity, recent harvest date, and lack of broken-off thread debris are all traits of fresh saffron.\\n\\nSeveral saffron {{155}}s are grown worldwide. Spain\\'s varieties, including the tradenames \\'Spanish Superior\\' and \\'Creme\\', are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish, while the most intense varieties tend to be {{156}}ian in origin. Westerners may face significant obstacles in obtaining saffron from India. For example, India has banned the export of high-grade saffron abroad. Aside from these, various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries, some organically grown. In the U.S., Pennsylvania Dutch saffron—known for its earthy notes—is marketed in small quantities.\\n\\nConsumers regard certain cultivars as \"premium\" quality. The \"Aquila\" saffron (zafferano dell\\'Aquila)—defined by high safranal and crocin content, shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour—is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy\\'s {{158}} region, near {{159}}. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican monk from {{160}} Spain. But in Italy the biggest saffron cultivation, for quality and quantity, is in San Gavino Monreale, {{161}}. There, saffron is grown on 40 hectares (60% of Italian production); it also has very high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the Kashmiri \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron (Crocus sativus \\'Cashmirianus\\'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir, combined with an Indian export ban, contribute to its high prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its extremely dark maroon-purple hue, among the world\\'s darkest, which suggests the saffron\\'s strong flavour, aroma, and colourative effect.\\n\\nSaffron types are graded by quality according to laboratory measurements of such characteristics as crocin (colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance) content. Other metrics include floral waste content (i.e. the saffron spice sample\\'s non-stigma floral content) and measurements of other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"ash\"). A uniform set of international standards in saffron grading was established by the {{162}}, which is an international federation of national standards bodies. Namely, ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron. It establishes four empirical grades of colour intensity: IV (poorest), III, II, and I (finest quality). Saffron samples are then assigned to one of these grades by gauging the spice\\'s crocin content, which is revealed by measurements of crocin-specific spectroscopic absorbance. Absorbance is defined as , with  as absorbance (Beer-Lambert law). It is a measure of a given substance\\'s transparency (, the ratio of light intensity passing through sample to that of the incident light) to a given wavelength of light.\\n\\nFor saffron, absorbance is determined for the crocin-specific {{165}} {{166}} of 440 {{167}} in a given dry sample of spice. Higher absorbances at this wavelength imply greater crocin concentration, and thus a greater colourative intensity. These data are measured through {{168}} reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. These colour grades proceed from grades with absorbances lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 190 or greater (for category I). The world\\'s finest samples (the selected most red-maroon tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive absorbance scores in excess of 250. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO scores. However, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. They prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of thread for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practiced by practised wine tasters.\\n\\nDespite such attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration–particularly among the cheapest grades–continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe\\'s Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the Safranschou code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like {{169}}, pomegranate fibers, red-dyed {{170}} fibers, or the saffron crocus\\'s tasteless and odorless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibers with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil. However, powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabeled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.',\n",

He was the father of {{5}}, who in 1066 became King of England.\\n\\nRobert was the second son of {{6}} and Judith. He was probably born between 1005 and 1010. \\nTheir father had decided that the older son, {{8}}, would succeed him as duke.  Robert would became Count of Hiémois. In August 1026 their father, Richard II, died and Richard III became the fifth duke. But once Richard III began to reign, Robert was not satisfied with his position. He raided the diocese of his uncle {{13}}. He also captured his brother's fortress city of {{15}}. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid siege to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised his fealty.\\n\\nWhen Richard III died shortly after Robert's surrender, there were suspicions that Robert might have caused his brother's death. Robert was accepted, however, as the sixth duke following his brother. But the civil war Robert I had started against his brother Richard III didn't stop when the two made peace. There were still many {{21}}s which had started between neighboring {{22}}s. These continued in Normandy during much of Robert’s reign. It was also during this time that many of the lesser nobility left Normandy to seek their fortunes in southern {{25}} and elsewhere. Soon after he became duke and possibly in revenge for supporting his brother, Robert I gathered an army and began raiding the lands of his uncle, {{27}}. Only a brief truce allowed his uncle to leave Normandy in exile. The Archbishop then placed an edict of excommunication on Robert and all of Normandy. The edict was only removed when Archbishop Robert was allowed to return and all his lands were restored. Robert also attacked another powerful church leader, his cousin Hugo d'Ivry, Bishop of {{32}}. Robert banished him from Normandy. Robert also seized a number of church properties belonging to the abbey of Fécamp.\\n\\nIn spite of all his troubles in Normandy Robert decided to get involved in the civil war in {{35}}. This feud was between {{36}} and his father {{37}} who the younger Baldwin had driven out of Flanders. Baldwin V, supported by king {{38}}, his father-in-law, was persuaded to make peace with his father in 1030. This happened only after Duke Robert promised the elder Baldwin his military support.\\n\\nRobert gave shelter to Henry I of France against his mother, {{41}}. The queen wanted her younger son Robert to succeed his father Robert II as {{43}}. For his help Henry I gave Robert the French Vexin. In the early 1030s Alan III, Duke of Brittany began to expand from the area of {{46}} and appeared to have wanted the area around {{47}} After raiding Dol and stopping Alan's attempts to raid {{49}}, Robert mounted a major campaign against his cousin Alan III. However, Alan appealed to Archbishop Robert of Rouen (they were both his nephews). The Archbishop arranged a peace between Duke Robert and his vassal Alan III.\\n\\nRobert's cousins, the Athelings {{53}} and Alfred, had been living in exile at the Norman Court. They were the sons of his aunt Emma of Normandy and {{56}}. At some point Robert attempted an invasion of England on their behalf but was stopped by unfavorable winds. The king of England, {{57}} sent envoys to Duke Robert offering to settle half the Kingdom of England on Edward and Alfred. After postponing the invasion he chose to also postpone the decision until after he returned from Jerusalem.\\n\\nRobert's attitude towards the Church changed completely since his uncle's return from exile.  To make up for what he had done to the Church earlier he restored all the property that he or his vassals had taken. He also decided to make a pilgrimage to {{59}} to make up for his sins. After making his illegitimate son {{61}} his heir, he set out on his pilgrimage. He travelled by way of {{63}} and reached Jerusalem. He fell seriously ill and died on the return journey at Nicaea on 2 July 1035. His son William, aged about eight, succeeded him.\\n\\nAccording to the historian William of Malmesbury, decades later, Robert's son William sent a mission to Constantinople and Nicaea to return his father's body to Normandy for burial. Permission was granted, but, having travelled as far as {{70}} (Italy) on the return journey, the envoys learned that William himself had died. They then decided to reinter Robert's body in Italy.\\n\\nBy his concubine, Herleva of Falaise, he was father of:\",\n",

After he finished school, at the age of 13, Philip Sidney went to {{1}} to study at Christ College. He did not however get any scholarly degree. He went to {{3}} when he witnessed the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. He also travelled to Germany, Austria and Hungary.  He was in Italy, too. He went as a messenger from {{5}} to Prague, where the emperor Maximilian II ruled. Then he went to a war in Netherlands. There he was wounded in the thigh 23 September 1586 at Zuphen. Because of that he got an infection and died at 17 October 1586 at {{7}}. He was buried on February 16, 1587 at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. \\n\\nPhilip Sidney is generally regarded as best English lyrical poet of the {{8}}. He was also considered a hero after his death Phillip Sidney wrote both poetry and prose. He is famous for his {{9}}s. They were edited in the sequence named Astophil and Stella. He also wrote Arcadia and The Defence of Poesy. Philip Sidney's poems were translated into many languages, among others into Czech. \\n\\nPhilip Sidney's sister was the poet and translator {{10}} Herbert, Countess of Pembroke (1561-1621).\",\n",

In 1775 he made the {{4}}, a trail through the {{5}} from {{6}} and {{7}} and through {{8}}. He spent the last 20 years of his life in {{9}}.\\n\\nBoone was born on October 24 1734 ({{10}}). Boone\\'s grandfather, George Boone, a {{11}}, {{12}}d from {{13}} in 1717. Daniel Boone was born in {{14}}, the son of Squire Boone and Sarah Morgan. His father was a {{15}} while his mother ran the family {{16}}. In addition to his chores on the farm, Boone learned to {{17}}, {{18}} and {{19}}. When he was 15 his family moved to the Yadkin Valley of {{21}}.\\n\\nBoone was a part of an {{22}} expedition in 1755 into French territory. When the column was attacked by Indians allied to the French, the British commander, {{23}} Edward Braddock was {{25}} and many of the soldiers were killed. This was the Battle of the Monongahela where then {{27}} George Washington rallied the British and the Virginia militia into an organized {{29}}. Boone, who was supervisor of the {{30}} was one of those who retreated with Washington. He returned to North Carolina and settled on a farm near his father\\'s. In 1756 he married Rebecca Bryan.\\n\\n1757 saw several more British defeats but life on Boone\\'s farm remained peaceful. In 1758 the British had several victories over the French. But at the same time their {{31}} allies were becoming tired of poor treatment by the British and the Americans. The {{32}} took advantage of this and encouraged the Cherokees to attack American homesteads. In 1759 the indians attacked in Virginia, North and {{34}}. To protect their families many {{35}}s left their farms for safer areas. Boone took his wife, two young sons, and all the belongings they could carry in a single wagon to Culpeper County, Virginia. To make a living Boone hauled {{37}} to market in {{38}}. In 1763 Boone and his family returned to their farm in North Carolina.\\n\\n \\n \\nBoone first heard of the lands of Kentucky while he was serving with General Braddock in 1755. The person he heard it from was John Findley, another member of the wagon train. Findley had been there as a {{39}}r at a Shawnee village called \"Blue Lick\". He talked about Kentucky as a {{41}} full of {{42}}. Boone decided he had to see Kentucky. On a long hunt in the {{43}} of 1767–68 he, his brother Squire and a friend named William Hill moved {{44}}ward trying to find Kentucky. They reached as far as the present site of {{45}} where they remained the rest of the winter. Not realizing they had reached Kentucky, they returned to North Carolina in the {{46}}. Boone again met John Findley and asked him for the route from North Carolina to Kentucky. Findley was not a backwoodsman but did know of a trail the Cherokee used when they made war on the Carolina colonies. In the {{48}} of 1769 Boone and five companions used the warrior\\'s trail to get to Kentucky. They hunted and explored the area. Most of his friends were killed or captured by Indians, but Boone and his brother escaped every time. He made another attempt to reach {{49}}ern Kentucky in 1763 but had to turn back. In 1775 he founded the settlement of {{50}}.\\n\\nIn 1778, Boone and a party were gathering {{51}} when they were attacked. Boone was captured and taken to {{52}} where the indians made him a member of their tribe. Boone soon escaped and returned to Boonesborough. In one of the last battles of the {{53}}, Boone, a lieutenant colonel, was at the Battle of Blue Licks on 19 August 1782. The Americans were led into an ambush. Boone was one of the last to retreat. His son Israel Boone was killed in the battle. Boone was the hero of the battle, but other leaders had not listened to his warnings that it was a trap. Boone remained a leading figure in Kentucky for the next 24 years. Through a series of defective land titles and being cheated by {{57}}, Boone lost all his lands in Kentucky. There were swarms of people coming into Kentucky and Boone felt crowded. Kentucky was no longer the {{58}} it was when he first came there. Now he wanted to discover new lands. He was drawn to the wilds of what is now eastern {{59}}.\\n\\n \\nIn 1799, Boone moved with much of his extended family to what is now {{60}}. It was then part of {{61}}. The area later became part of Missouri. The {{62}} were eager to promote settlement in the sparsely populated region. So they did not enforce the requirement that all immigrants had to be Roman Catholic. The Spanish governor appointed Boone \"syndic\" ({{65}}) of the Femme {{66}} district. Boone served as syndic and commandant until 1804, when the area became part of the {{67}}. His land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements. But the former Lieutenant-governor, Zenon Trudeau made the promise in writing and Boone\\'s lands were confirmed. But Boone had not made the necessary improvements under the law and the lands were again taken away. About 1810 Boone sent a petition to Congress to restore his lands. It took them until 1814 to create a special bill which was signed by {{68}} {{69}} on 10 February 1814. Boone spent his final years in Missouri, often in the company of children and grandchildren, where he continued to hunt and trap as much as his health and energy levels permitted. He died on 26 September 1820 just before {{70}}. His body was taken to Charette, Louisiana territory (now {{71}}) and buried next to his wife Rebecca.\\n\\nIn 1845 a group from Kentucky removed the bones of Daniel and Rebecca Boone from their cemetery in Missouri. They took them to {{72}} to be buried in a tomb there. Reverend Philip Fall made a plaster cast of the {{73}} of the body they removed from Missouri. The plaster cast was then presented to the Kentucky State Historical Society. In 1862 the State of Kentucky created a monument over the grave in the Frankfurt cemetery.\\n\\nA forensic anthropologist, Dr. David Wolf, examined the plaster cast and stated it was probably that of a black slave. Wolf said the cast made by Rev. Fall did not provide enough evidence to be certain, but several clues also point to the conclusion it may not be Daniel Boone. Wolf stated he does not believe the skull shape, slope of the brow, the brow ridges and occipital bone are {{77}}. The body removed from Missouri was that of a \"large and robust man\". According to Boone\\'s {{78}} Daniel Bryan described Boone as about 5 foot 8 or 9 inches tall. Boone had {{79}} hair and {{80}} {{81}}.\\n\\nSeveral Missouri historians have stated before that the bones taken from the Missouri cemetery were actually those of a slave. When Boone died at age 85, the gravediggers discovered an unmarked body had been buried next to Rebecca Boone (died 1813). The stranger was left in his grave and Daniel was buried at the foot of his wife\\'s grave. But 16 years later a gravestone was mistakenly placed over the stranger\\'s grave. When the party from Kentucky took the bodies in 1845 they took the bodies of Rebecca and the stranger next to her, wrongly marked as Daniel Boone. Both states claim to have the actual grave of Daniel Boone.',\n",

She was also serving as Deputy Attorney General from March 2015 until her dismissal on January 30, 2017.\\n\\nOn January 30, 2017, President Donald Trump fired her after saying she won't defend his executive order on the immigration ban.\\n\\nSally Yates explained her decision not to defend the executive order in the following letter to the DOJ employees:\\n\\nOn January 27, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order regarding immigrants and refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries. The order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions. As the Acting Attorney General, it is my ultimate responsibility to determine the position of the Department of Justice in these actions.\\n\\nMy role is different from that of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which, through administrations of both parties, has reviewed Executive Orders for form and legality before they are issued. OLC’s review is limited to the narrow question of whether, in OLC’s view, a proposed Executive Order is lawful on its face and properly drafted. Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order’s purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just.\\n\\nSimilarly, in litigation, DOJ Civil Division lawyers are charged with advancing reasonable legal arguments that can be made supporting an Executive Order. But my role as leader of this institution is different and broader. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.\\n\\nConsequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\\n\\nA career prosecutor in Atlanta who has served under both Republican and Democrat administrations, Sally Yates has been hailed as a hero by both parties. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, introduced her at her confirmation hearing in 2015.\\n\\n“She will be a hero of the American people, a hero of what’s right,” Mr. Isakson said at the time. “She’ll call them like she sees them, and she will be fair, and she will be just.”\\n\\nAt those hearings, Republicans were furious about former President Barack Obama’s order liberalizing immigration policy and questioned Ms. Yates about whether she would be willing to stand up to the president. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, was particularly pointed in his questioning.\\n\\n“If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say ‘No?’” Mr. Sessions asked.\\n\\n“I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,” Ms. Yates replied.\",\n",

Under its current Chief Executive, Ben Summerskill, it was closely involved in successful parliamentary campaigns to repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act (2003); make attacks on gay people separate crimes (that is, anti-gay hate crimes), through the Criminal Justice Act 2003; introduce the Civil Partnership Act 2004 giving gay and lesbian couples \"civil union\" almost the same as a civil marriage; and introduce the \"2007 Sexual Orientation Regulations\" under the Equality Act 2006, to stop discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.\\n\\nStonewall helps 300 big employers across Britain by giving advice and support to lesbian and gay staff.

       "  'text': 'The magnetic moment of a {{0}} is a quantity that determines the {{1}} that the magnet can exert on electric currents and the {{2}} that a {{3}} will exert on it. A loop of {{4}}, a bar {{5}}, an {{6}}, a {{7}}, and a {{8}} all have magnetic moments.\\n\\nBoth the magnetic moment and magnetic field may be considered to be {{9}}s having a magnitude and direction. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of a magnet.  The magnetic field produced by a magnet is proportional to its magnetic moment as well.  More precisely, the term magnetic moment normally refers to a system\\'s  magnetic dipole moment, which produces the first term in the multipole expansion of a general magnetic field. The {{11}} component of an object\\'s magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.\\n\\nIn text books, two complementary approaches are used to define magnetic moments. In pre-1930\\'s textbooks, they were defined using magnetic poles. Most recent textbooks define it in terms of Ampèrian currents.\\n\\nPhysicists represent sources of magnetic moments in materials as poles. The North and South poles are an analogy to the positive and negative charges in {{12}}. Consider a bar magnet which has magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite polarity. Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since s always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels.  This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors:  on both the strength  of its poles, and on the vector  separating them. The moment is defined as\\n\\nIt points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with {{15}} (see Magnetic moment and angular momentum). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for magnetostatic calculations, particularly in applications to {{18}}. Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the {{19}} by the irrotational field , in analogy to the {{21}} .\\n\\nSuppose a planar closed loop carries an {{22}}  and has vector area  (, , and  coordinates of this vector are the areas of projections of the loop onto the , , and  planes). Its magnetic moment , {{24}}, is defined as:\\n\\nBy convention, the direction of the vector area is given by the right hand grip rule (curling the fingers of one\\'s right hand in the direction of the current around the loop, when the palm of the hand is \"touching\" the loop\\'s outer edge, and the straight thumb indicates the direction of the vector area and thus of the magnetic moment).\\n\\nIf the loop is not planar, the moment is given as\\n\\nIn the most general case of an arbitrary current distribution in space, the magnetic moment of such a distribution can be found from the following equation:\\n\\nwhere  is the position vector pointing from the origin to the location of the volume element, and  is the current density vector at that location.\\n\\nThe above equation can be used for calculating a magnetic moment of any assembly of moving charges, such as a spinning charged solid, by substituting\\n\\nwhere  is the electric charge density at a given point and  is the instantaneous linear velocity of that point.\\n\\nFor example, the magnetic moment produced by an electric charge  moving  along a circular path is\\n\\nwhere  is the position of the charge  relative to the center of the circle and  is the instantaneous velocity of the charge.\\n\\nPractitioners using the current loop model generally represent the magnetic field by the solenoidal field , analogous to the electrostatic field .\\n\\nA generalization of the above current loop is a multi-turn coil, or {{28}}. Its moment is the vector sum of the moments of individual turns. If the solenoid has  identical turns (single-layer winding),\\n\\nThe unit for magnetic moment is not a base unit in the {{30}} (SI) and it can be represented in more than one way. For example, in the current loop definition, the area is measured in {{32}}s and  is measured in amperes, so the magnetic moment is measured in ampere–square meters (). In the equation for torque on a moment, the torque is measured in Newton.meters and the magnetic field in {{35}}, so the moment is measured in N.m per Tesla (). These two representations are equivalent:\\n\\nIn the CGS system, there are several different sets of electromagnetism units, of which the main ones are ESU, Gaussian, and EMU. Among these, there are two alternative (non-equivalent) units of magnetic dipole moment in CGS:\\n\\nand (more frequently used)\\n\\nThe ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal exactly to the {{40}}, expressed in {{41}}/{{42}}.\\n\\nAll formulas in this article are correct in {{43}} units, but in other unit systems, the formulas may need to be changed. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current I and area A has magnetic moment I×A (see below), but in Gaussian units the magnetic moment is I×A/{{45}}.\\n\\nFor relation between the notions of magnetic moment and magnetization see magnetization.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Gioachino Rossini (born {{0}} {{1}} {{2}}; died Passy {{4}} {{5}}) was an {{6}} {{7}}. He was the most famous composer of {{8}}s in his time. His operas had lots of new ideas. Italian operas had become rather unimaginative, with composers such as Cimarosa and {{10}} writing the same sort of thing each time. Rossini made his operas interesting by writing skillfully for the singers, giving them good tunes, as well as giving the orchestra interesting music, and by choosing a variety of stories for his operas. The opera for which he is best known today is the {{11}} (The Barber of Seville). Many of the {{12}}s to his operas are played at orchestral concerts. The most popular is the overture to his opera Guillaume Tell (William Tell) with its feature in the British TV show The Adventures of William Tell\\n\\nDuring the last 40 years of his life Rossini wrote no more music. His friends begged him to write another opera but he always refused.\\n\\nRossini was born on 29 February of the leap year 1792. His birthplace was Pesaro, a small town in Italy on the Adriatic coast. His father played the {{15}} in military {{16}}s and {{17}}s and his mother sang in {{18}}s. Often his parents toured together and the young Rossini was left in the care of his {{19}}. The family eventually settled in {{20}}. Rossini had lessons in {{21}}, {{22}}, {{23}} and {{24}}. He did not like the counterpoint lessons, but it did help him to study different styles of music and he became very good at writing {{25}} in a clear way.\\n\\nItalian opera at this time needed a new composer to bring more life into it. Five of his first nine operas were written for the Teatro S Moise in {{26}}. Other theatres soon asked him to write operas. In 1812 he wrote La pietra del paragone for the {{27}} in {{28}}. It was a great success. Many of these early operas were {{29}} operas ({{30}}). Sometimes he had to produce so many new operas that he kept reusing some of the music he had already written in another opera. Nevertheless they include a lot of fine music, and Rossini was developing his musical personality. His overtures have a fine sense of orchestral colour. He often started with a slow section and then went into fast music with a {{31}}. Because he did this a lot it is often called a “Rossini crescendo” or “Rossini rocket”.\\n\\nIt was not easy for him to earn enough money to keep himself. He only got paid for the operas he took part in. There were no {{32}} laws in those days. The important singers were well paid, but the composers earned much less. We know very little about his life at this time, but we do know that he travelled a lot. His most famous operas from this period are Tancredi, La Gazza Ladra (The Thieving Magpie) and {{33}} (The Barber of Seville) which has often been called the greatest of all comic operas.\\n\\nBy 1815 Rossini’s operas were famous everywhere in Western Europe except in {{34}}. {{35}} opera had been famous throughout the {{36}} and the city was proud of its tradition. The Neapolitans did not want a young composer from the north to continue their operatic tradition. Nevertheless, Rossini soon won their hearts. He wrote for the Teatro S Carlo which had a fine orchestra and very good singers. He wrote many of his best serious operas ({{37}}) for Naples, and this tradition which he built up made it possible for {{38}} to take over thirty years later as Italy’s leading opera composer.\\n\\nRossini’s international fame took him to {{39}} where he met Beethoven. After returning to Italy for a while he travelled to {{41}} and {{42}}. He was only 31 years old and had written 34 operas. The Paris audiences already knew his operas. In {{43}} a Rossini Festival was organized. Most of the time in England he spent at social parties at the houses of rich people who were glad to pay him money to come and be their guest. Soon after this he settled in Paris for five years. He was director of the Théâtre-Italien until 1836. His two greatest operas from this period were Le Comte Ory (which was an opéra comique) and Guillaume Tell which was based on a play by {{44}}. These works have beautifully flowing tunes (like Italian opera) as well as grand drama (like French opera).\\n\\nIn 1829, at the age of 37, Rossini decided to retire. He had lots of money but his health was not particularly good. Although he wrote a few small pieces of music he never composed another opera. He went back to Bologna, although he returned to Paris nearly 20 years later with his wife. Here his health improved and he wrote a little music. His Petite messe solennelle for 12 voices, two pianos and {{45}} is still performed today. When he died in 1868 thousands of people came to his {{46}}.\\n\\nRossini was a composer of the classical period. He was brought up hearing 18th century opera, and much of his best known music is still Classical in style, but he developed a lot as he matured and was writing in a more Romantic way by the end of his career. He gradually stopped writing music which has set numbers all the time: music divided sharply into arias and {{47}}. His recitative became more expressive and was accompanied by the orchestra instead of by a {{48}}. This helped to make his music more continuous. He did not often write for {{49}} as they were going out of fashion. The chorus have an important part in the drama of his operas (in 18th century opera they just used to comment on what was going on).',\n",

Most guaraná drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries, such as {{32}}. Major brands include Guaraná Antarctica, Guaraná Schin from Schincariol and Guaraná Brahma from AmBev, Kuat, and Guaraná Jesus, a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it. Many local producers also create drinks not for export.\\n\\nStudies involving guaraná show benefits to cognitive function. They have not been evaluated by the {{38}} ({{39}}) or any similar government agencies. In the United States, guaraná holds a GRAS-status, i.e. generally regarded as safe and must be labeled as not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\\n\\nThe Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in {{41}} {{42}}. This study shows  an average 11.2 pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of {{43}}, guaraná and damiana, compared to an average 1 pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days.\\n\\nA {{45}} study in {{46}} of guaraná extract showed a {{47}} aggregation decrease of up to 37% of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 78% of control values. This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs, an arterial blood clot can develop, resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke.\\n\\nA separate 1997 study of guaraná\\'s effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo.\\n\\nOther studies have shown {{49}}, {{50}}, and {{51}} cell reduction (when combined with conjugated linoleic acid) properties in guaraná   \\n\\nAlthough side-effects of guaraná are rare, drugs.com recommends, \"When considering the use of herbal supplements, consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable. Additionally, consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal/health supplements may be beneficial, and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous\". Drugs.com also advises not to mix guaraná with {{53}}.\\n\\nGuaraná seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and {{55}} with a small amount of oil and water. Guarana contains different amounts of {{56}}, {{57}}, theophylline and other alkaloids, compared to coffee, tea, {{59}}, or {{60}}. \\n\\nDuke1992a: Duke, James A. 1992.

His family came to dig {{3}} in {{4}}.  When he was 12 years old he got a job working with {{5}}\\n\\nWhen he was about 20 years old, Gilbert was living in New South Wales near {{6}}.  He became a member of a {{7}} which was led by {{8}}.  Another member of the gang was {{9}}.  With Gardiner and Hall, Gilbert was involved with the biggest gold robbery in Australia\\'s history: in {{11}} the gang {{12}} a {{13}} carrying gold at {{14}}. After the robbery, Gardiner went to {{15}} to hide from the police. John Gilbert went to New Zealand. When he came back in May 1863, he started a new gang with Ben Hall.\\n\\nThe Ben Hall gang robbed travelers on the roads, the mail coaches, the gold escorts, hotels, farm houses and even held up whole towns. The police seemed to be unable to stop the gang. At first people thought this was fun, the police being made to look like fools. Gilbert and {{17}} did the first daylight bank robbery in Australia in July 1863. They rode into the town of {{18}} and tried to take money from the bank. The man working at the bank grabbed his gun and fired it twice. Gilbert and O\\'Meally ran out of the bank, quickly got on to their horses and rode away.\\n\\nBut as the number of robberies continued, people became scared and wanted the government to do something. In {{19}} Gilbert killed a {{20}}, Sergeant Edmund Parry, during a robbery near {{21}}. The police search for Gilbert became urgent.\\n\\nAt Springfield, near {{22}}, Gilbert tried to rob four young brothers. The boys fired their guns and kept the bushrangers back. Gilbert tried to shoot one of the boys, but his stolen race horse (called \"Young Waverly\") got in the way. The horse died immediately and Gilbert was trapped under the dead horse. People thought that this was very funny; a dangerous bushranger being made to look like a fool by a group of boys.\\n\\nIn {{23}} another another policeman was killed by another member of the gang, {{24}}.  Members of the gang were declared {{25}}s.  This meant they could be killed by anyone at anytime. The police shot Ben Hall dead near Forbes on May 5, 1865. On {{26}}, {{27}} Gilbert and Dunn went to hide at John Kelly\\'s (Dunn\\'s grandfather) house. Kelly told the police at {{28}} where the two bushrangers were hiding so he could get the reward money. The police went to the house, but Gilbert and Dunn climbed out a window and ran down to Billabong Creek to escape into the bush. Constable King was shot in the foot, and Dunn was shot in the arm. Gilbert was shot dead when he stopped to shoot back at {{29}} John Bright  After an inquest to record how he died, he was buried at Binalong, in the field where the police kept their horses. Gilbert was a bad {{31}}.  He had been in 630 robberies. Dunn escaped but was captured six months later. He was hanged in Sydney in March 1866.\\n\\nThe story of John Gilbert was told in a {{32}}, How Gilbert Diedhttp://scs.une.edu.au/Bushrangers/poetry.htm#gilbert%20died, by Australian {{33}}, {{34}}.

DKA happens mostly in people with {{2}}, although it may happen in some people that have {{3}}.\\n\\nDKA happens when a person does not have enough insulin in their body.  All of the {{4}}s in the body need {{5}} (sugar) to survive, because the body needs {{6}}.  Insulin breaks down {{7}} into a form that the body can use for energy.  Without insulin, sugar stays in the blood and cannot get into the cells.  This causes {{8}} and makes it impossible for the cells to use glucose to make energy.\\n\\nDKA can be caused by not having enough insulin, eating too many {{9}}s, and sometimes physical or mental stress.  DKA can also be a sign that a person has diabetes that has not been discovered, or is not being controlled well.\\n\\nDKA is {{10}} through blood and {{12}} testing.  These tests will show high blood sugar, which does not happen with other forms of ketoacidosis.\\n\\nDKA was first discovered around 1886.  Before insulin therapy was first used in the 1920s, DKA almost always caused death.\\n\\n{{13}}s of DKA include:\\n\\nAs DKA gets worse, it can cause these symptoms:\\n\\nWithout proper treatment, DKA can cause death.\\n\\nFirst, because there is not enough insulin to bring glucose into the cells, glucose builds up in the blood.  This causes there to be too much sugar in the blood and not enough in the cells.  The cells start starving, because they do not have insulin to break down glucose into a form that the cells can use for energy.\\n\\nTo try to create energy for the cells, the {{14}} breaks down fat into {{15}}s and {{16}}s.  These create a little bit of energy, but they are also {{17}}ic.  The blood starts to get too acidic, and the body starts to get poisoned.\\n\\nBecause the cells still do not have enough glucose to create the energy they need, the liver also breaks down glycogen to make more glucose.  (The body stores sugar in different forms in case it needs energy later.  Glucagon helps break down some of these sugar stores into glucose.)  However, there is still not enough insulin in the blood to break down the glucose into energy.  Because of this, the glucose stays in the blood (making the blood sugar levels get even higher) and the cells keep starving.\\n\\nNext, the body begins to break down {{18}}.  (When the body cannot create enough energy by breaking down fat and glycogen into sugar, it breaks down protein.)  This causes the {{19}}s in the body to lose {{20}}.\\n\\nNow there is much more glucose in the bloodstream than in the cells.  The body always tries to stay in {{21}}.  In homeostasis, there would be an equal amount of sugar in the bloodstream and the cells.  To try to make this happen, the cells (which have very little sugar in them) give up water to the blood (which is very sugary).  The goal is to try to dilute the sugar in the blood, and decrease the high levels of hyperglycemia.  If the cells give up too much water, they can get {{22}} (not have enough fluid left in them).  Because DKA also causes a person to urinate often, a person with DKA can get dehydrated very quickly.  This dehydration can be a medical emergency.\\n\\nThe {{23}}s try to filter out the extra glucose in the bloodstream.  This causes glucosuria (too much sugar in the urine).  The extra glucose going through the kidneys causes more urine to be created.  When a person urinates more, they lose more {{24}}s, like {{25}} and {{26}}.  Without enough electrolytes, the heart, muscles, and {{27}} cannot work properly.  Also, eventually, the {{28}} because they are overworked by the amount of glucose they are trying to filter.\\n\\nPeople with DKA need to be treated in a hospital.  Usually, treatment involves:',\n",

A patch of moss is made of many tiny moss plants packed together so that they can hold water for as long as possible. They do not have roots, and could not get water from them if they did. Because they cannot find water, they live in two ways. They can live in places that are always wet; like near a spring, a river, or in a place where there is a lot of fog. They can also dry up when there is no moisture. This means they they can never live in dry places like deserts.  \\n\\nThey cannot grow very large because they could not move water to the top of the moss.  The largest moss grows in New Zealand, and is about 30 cm tall. \\n\\nA moss does not make {{7}}s. A moss does not have {{8}}. The green fuzzy part of a moss that is always there has only half of the moss DNA. When the moss has made lots of food and there is enough water, cells from different moss plants swim inside a clump of moss. Two cells combine to make a cell with a full set of moss DNA. This cell grows into a different kind of moss plant- but it gets all of its food from a green fuzzy moss plant. When the cell grows, it makes tiny {{10}}s instead of seeds. The spores are like dust. They come from a little box that grows up out of the moss. The box has a lid that falls off. Then the spores come out and float away. They will make more moss.\\n\\nScientists divide the mosses into eight groups.  Five of these groups are small, with just a few species; most mosses are in the group called Bryopsida.',\n",

BMW also supplied the M12/13 engine to the ATS, {{8}}, {{9}} and Ligier teams. In , Brabham left F1 for the  season, and BMW stopped its official backing of the engines. Arrows still used the engine with the Megatron name. When Formula One banned turbocharged engines in , the M12/13 could no longer be used.\\n\\nBMW returned to Formula One in . They made a deal to supply engines to only the {{12}} team. The engine was a new {{13}}. The engine deal with Williams ended after the  season. BMW then bought the rival {{14}} team. The {{15}} project lasted from  until . Sauber, a former privateer team, became more competitive. In , {{16}} won the team\\'s only race, the {{17}}, with {{18}} finishing second. After the 2009 season, BMW withdrew from F1. They sold the team back to its founder, Peter Sauber.\\n\\nThe early years of the {{20}} saw private BMW racing cars, based on the pre-war {{21}} 328 chassis. They were entered in the {{22}} in  and . A modified 328 with a rear engine became standard in Formula One in the early 1960s. It was known as the \"Heck\", the German automotive term for \"back\" or \"rear\". This design later found success with the Cooper team.\\n\\nIn  German Grand Prix, BMW entered Hubert Hahne in a Lola chassis powered by an larger BMW engine, and David Hobbs in the Lola with the standard smaller BMW engine. For the  German Grand Prix, Hahne returned and finished tenth, BMW\\'s best result in Formula One to that date. BMW then entered three of its own 269 F2 chassis for the  German Grand Prix for Hahne, Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester. Mitter was killed in a practice accident. The remaining BMW team withdrew from the race. BMW left F1 for a number of years.\\n\\nIn , {{30}} entered Formula One with a {{31}} engine. After the success Renault had, BMW decided to develop its own turbo engine. BMW announced the new program in April 1980. The engine was based on the BMW M10, a four-cylinder, 1.5 litre, normally aspirated (non-turbocharged) engine designed in the late 1950s. The racing version, the M12, had been successful in Formula Two and other series. The prototype 1.4 litre turbo engine soon developed 600 {{32}}. It used a single Kühnle, Kopp & Kausch (KKK) turbocharger,  Bosch electronics, and fuel injection. This engine was developed into the M12/13, the race engine BMW supplied to five teams from 1982 to 1988.\\n\\nBMW first made a deal to supply the M12/13 engine only to the {{33}}. Testing of the M12/13 started in late 1980. A new car, Brabham BT50 was design for the engine. The new car was not finished until will into the  season. The team\\'s lead driver, {{34}}, tested the BT50 throughout 1981. The car was unreliable until Bosch improved the electronics.\\n\\nBrabham began the {{35}} with two BMW-powered BT50 chassis. Because of reliability problems, the BT50 was not used at all the races that year. BMW saw their first win in  {{36}}, where the cool conditions helped the turbocharged engine. The BT50 was used for the rest of the season. The car was still unreliable, and the drivers only made four finishes the rest of the season.\\n\\nIn , the reliability of the BMW engine was improved. The new Brabham BT52 allowed {{37}} to win the Drivers\\' Championship. Brabham finished third in the Constructors\\' Championship. BMW also began supplying its engines to the German ATS team this season. Manfred Winkelhock, the only driver for the team, was unable to score any points.\\n\\nFor , BMW expanded to three teams, supplying the M12/13 to {{40}}. In , BMW was back to two teams. ATS had left Formula One. Piquet won one race, the  {{41}}. It was the only win for BMW that year.\\n\\nFor the {{42}}, BMW was back to three teams with the addition of {{43}}. Benetton had the most success, scoring 19 points, and winning the {{44}}. In , BMW only supplied Brabham with works engines. Arrows and Ligier used the \"Megatron\", a rebadged BMW engine. At the end of the year, Benetton team owner {{46}} decided not to compete the following year. This ended the BMW turbo engine. The Arrows team still used the \"Megatrons\" engine for . They finished fifth in the Constructors\\' Championship, their best finish in the team\\'s 25-year history.\\n\\nFor , the technical regulations were changed to ban turbocharged engines. During the M12/13 engine\\'s time in F1, the engine had won the 1983 Drivers\\' Championship and nine Grands Prix. It also took 14 pole positions and set 13 fastest laps.\\n\\nWilliams had been very successful using {{47}} engines. They won the , ,  and  Drivers\\' Championships. They also won the , , ,  and  Constructors\\' Championships. When Renault left F1 at the end of 1997, Williams needed a new engine. In , the BMW signed a contract to supply the {{48}} team with engines.\\n\\nBMW spent 18 months building and testing a normally aspirated, 3.0 litre {{49}}. The E41 engine was ready to race in the {{50}}. The Williams FW22 with the BMW E41 engine was driven by {{51}} and {{52}}. Schumacher scored a podium finish in the engine\\'s first race. The team finished the year with two more podium finishes, and third in the Constructors\\' Championship.\\n\\nFor , BMW designed a more aggressive P80 engine. The engine had a big power improvement. Schumacher and new team-mate {{53}} scored four race wins. For , the team won only one race with Schumacher at the {{54}}. Montoya took seven pole positions, but was not able to win a single race.\\n\\nThe Williams team was more competitive in . Both drivers won on two time. For , Williams produced the FW26 chassis with a radical nose section. This design did not work very well. Williams slipped to fourth in the Constructors\\' Championship. Montoya\\'s victory in the {{55}} the team\\'s only win (and the team\\'s final win to date). Both Schumacher and Montoya left the team at the end of the season.\\n\\n was the final year of Williams using the BMW engine. The team continued to be less competitive. None of the team\\'s drivers were able to win a race. By this time, BMW was upset with Williams. BMW thought the engine was able to win, and the Williams chassis was the problem. BMW offered to buy Williams outright. They wanted to gain overall control of its Formula One efforts. Frank Williams would not sell the team. BMW chose to buy the rival {{56}} team instead for  and end its deal with Williams.\\n\\nBMW bought {{57}} team {{58}} in June 2005 to form the BMW Sauber F1 Team. The takeover came after BMW\\'s relationship with Williams had deteriorated in the previous months, the partnership ending at the end of the  season. The team was based at Sauber\\'s headquarters in {{59}}, {{60}} and BMW\\'s headquarters in {{61}}, {{62}}.\\n\\nThe team scored two podium finishes and came fifth in {{63}}, its first season in Formula One. This was followed by a second place in {{64}} after the McLaren team had been excluded from the championship. {{65}} driver {{66}} took the team\\'s only Grand Prix victory at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. Following a poor  season, BMW withdrew from Formula One and sold the team back to founder Peter Sauber.\\n\\nFor the {{69}}, BMW Sauber signed {{70}} from {{71}} to be the lead driver, while  World Champion {{72}} had his existing two-year contract with Sauber honoured. {{73}} was signed as the team\\'s third driver. The team continued to use Sauber\\'s facilities, mostly for chassis construction and wind tunnel testing, while BMW\\'s headquarters in Munich were responsible for building the new 2.4 litre P86 {{75}}, revised technical regulations forcing a change from the 3 litre {{76}} formula. This replaced the {{77}}-badged Ferrari engines which the team had used since 1997. The Sauber team\\'s existing major sponsors, Petronas and Credit Suisse, renewed their contracts with BMW. The team also announced a technical partnership with technology company {{79}}. The team\\'s new livery, which was maintained throughout its tenure in Formula One, consisted of the traditional BMW blue and white with a hint of red.\\n\\nVilleneuve scored the team\\'s first points with a seventh-place finish at the Malaysian Grand Prix, after Heidfeld retired from fifth with an engine failure late in the race. Over the first two thirds of the season the drivers picked up points with a succession of seventh and eighth-place finishes, plus a fourth-place finish for Heidfeld at the Australian Grand Prix. The team ran a radical \"twin towers\" aero enhancement on the front of the car for the French Grand Prix, which was meant improve the flow of air over the top of the chassis. The parts were promptly banned by the {{83}} (FIA) as they were adjudged to impede the drivers\\' vision and thus compromise safety.\\n\\nHeidfeld scored the team\\'s first podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix from tenth on the grid. This race also saw the début of {{85}}, who replaced Villeneuve after the latter had crashed heavily at the preceding German Grand Prix. Kubica finished seventh, although he was later disqualified after his car was found to be underweight. The official reason for Villeneuve\\'s absence was that he was recovering from his previous accident, but the team later announced that the driver change was permanent. Kubica scored BMW Sauber\\'s second podium finish of the season at the Italian Grand Prix, after running in third place for most of the race and leading briefly during the first round of pit stops. Heidfeld finished in eighth, but set the team\\'s first fastest lap. The team scored a total of 36 points to finish fifth in the Constructors\\' Championship, an improvement on Sauber\\'s eighth position with 20 points in .\\n\\nOn 19 October 2006, BMW announced that {{88}} would partner {{89}} for the {{90}} with Sebastian Vettel taking the test and reserve driver role. {{91}} was later signed as the team\\'s second test driver. The team launched its 2007 car, the F1.07, on January 16, 2007.\\n\\nThe new car showed promising form throughout winter testing, topping the times sheets on occasions. However, team principal Mario Theissen declared some reliability concerns before the season\\'s opening race in Australia. Kubica retired from fourth place with a gearbox problem, but Heidfeld took over the position and held it to the end of the race. In the early races of the season, Heidfeld and Kubica scored a series of points finishes and established BMW Sauber as the third-fastest team, behind {{95}} and McLaren. Theissen also made the point that the performance gap between BMW Sauber and the two top teams was less than the gap between BMW Sauber and the teams behind it.\\n\\nThe Canadian Grand Prix brought mixed fortunes for the team. While Heidfeld scored BMW Sauber\\'s best result thus far with a second-place finish, Kubica suffered a huge crash that resulted in a long safety car period. The media was initially told Kubica had broken his leg, but it later proved that he had escaped with only a sprained ankle and concussion. Vettel took his place in the United States Grand Prix, finishing in eighth place and therefore becoming the youngest driver to score a Formula One World Championship point. Later in the season, Vettel moved teams to take a race seat at the {{99}} team.\\n\\nKubica returned to racing action at the French Grand Prix and proved his recovery by finishing in fourth position. Over the remainder of the season, he and Heidfeld continued their form to score a total of 101 points, which secured the team second in the Constructors\\' Championship after McLaren\\'s disqualification. Heidfeld scored another podium finish at the Hungarian Grand Prix and scored 61 points to Kubica\\'s 39, while Vettel\\'s sole appearance produced an additional point.\\n\\nOn August 21, 2007, BMW confirmed its driver line-up of {{102}} and {{103}} for the  season.\\nTheir 2008 car, the F1.08 was officially launched in {{105}} at BMW Welt on January 14, 2008. It made its track debut at Valencia the next day, with Robert Kubica driving. Team principal Mario Theissen set the target of the team\\'s first win.\\n\\nBMW Sauber started the season well with Kubica narrowly missing out on pole after a mistake in his main qualifying lap in Melbourne. He later retired after being hit by {{108}} but Heidfeld finished second. Kubica took second in Malaysia, with Heidfeld in 6th setting the fastest lap of the race. The team\\'s points total of 11 was their largest score up to that time. In Bahrain, Kubica scored his and the team\\'s first ever pole position, beating {{111}} by just under three hundredths of a second. The team went on to finish 3rd and 4th in the race, equalling their highest round points total and promoting them to first place in the constructors\\' championship for the first time.\\n\\nThe team also attained a second-place finish in the Monaco Grand Prix with {{113}}, beating both Ferraris and only trailing the McLaren of {{115}} by three seconds.\\n\\nBMW Sauber\\'s first race victory came in the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, the team achieving a one-two finish with Robert Kubica\\'s first race win and Nick Heidfeld taking second place. The victory came after Lewis Hamilton collided with Kimi Räikkönen in the pitlane, ending the race for both drivers. Kubica was on a different refueling strategy from Heidfeld, who also briefly led the race before securing the one-two finish for BMW Sauber in comfortable fashion.\\n\\nAfter the team\\'s breakthrough win, development was switched to the 2009 season where new regulations come into play. This greatly annoyed Kubica, (who was leading the championship after the Canadian Grand Prix), as he felt they could have had a realistic chance of taking at least one title. The lack of development was reflected with a drop of form throughout the second half of the season, causing BMW to be outpaced by Renault, Toyota and even Toro Rosso (who started the season as one of the slowest teams) by the end of the season. Despite this, Kubica remained with an outside chance of taking the drivers championship until the Chinese Grand Prix, the 17th round out of 18.\\n\\nIn October the team confirmed that they would stick with {{117}} and {{118}} as their drivers for the  Season.\\n\\nAlthough BMW Sauber targeted the  season as the year they would challenge for the title, their start to the season was a disappointment. Kubica was running in 3rd place in the opening round when he collided with Vettel while battling for 2nd place and was forced to retire. Heidfeld then secured the team\\'s first podium of the year in Malaysia, but after 6 races BMW Sauber had collected a mere 6 points, and occupied 8th place in the Constructors\\' Championship out of 10 teams. A raft of upgrades were set for Turkey, including an improved regenerative braking system (KERS) and a double deck diffuser. While the new diffuser was implemented, the KERS could not be made to fit the new car and both drivers raced without the device. After the qualifying session for the British Grand Prix Mario Theissen announced that the team had decided to halt further development KERS; of which BMW had been one of the strongest proponents, and focus instead on improving the car\\'s aerodynamics. This left Ferrari and McLaren as the only remaining users of the KERS system. In the European Grand Prix at Valencia {{125}} scored the team\\'s first points since the race in Turkey.\\n\\nFollowing a meeting of the BMW board on July 28, the company held at press conference the following morning in which it confirmed the team\\'s withdrawal from Formula One at the end of 2009. Chairman Dr Norbert Reithofer described the decision as a strategic one. The Formula One Teams Association released a statement in response pledging its support to help the team remain in F1.\\n\\nOn 15 September 2009 it was announced that BMW Sauber had secured a buyer, Qadbak Investments Limited which said to represent European and Middle Eastern interests. However Lotus had been given the 13th and final slot in the 2010 Championship.  The team were awarded what was termed a 14th entry, which hinges either on another team dropping out or all the other teams agreeing to allow 28 cars to enter the 2010 Championship.\\n\\nOn November 22, Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung revealed that Qadbak\\'s attempt to purchase the team had failed as it did not have the necessary funds. Qadbak turned out to be a shell company with no assets and no investors behind it. On November 27, 2009 it was announced that Peter Sauber would repurchase the team conditional upon the team receiving a FIA entry for the 2010 season.  The FIA subsequently granted Sauber an entry on December 3. The team used {{132}} engines in .\\n\\nThe team retained the BMW Sauber name for the  season, despite using {{133}} engines.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Canton Ticino or Ticino ([]; French and German: Tessin [] and []) is the southernmost {{2}} of {{3}}. The written language is Italian in almost the entire {{5}} (except the Walser {{7}} of {{8}}, where it is German). It surrounds the {{10}} {{11}} of Campione d'Italia. Together with areas of the canton of {{13}} it makes up the so-called Svizzera Italiana (Italian Switzerland). Lombard dialects (Ticinese) are still spoken, especially in the valleys, but they have no official status. It is named after the {{17}}.\\n\\nThe canton of Ticino is located in the south of Switzerland. It is almost entirely surrounded by {{18}} which lies to its east, west and south. To the north lie the cantons of {{19}} and {{20}}, to the northeast the canton of {{21}}.\\n\\nIts area is 2,812 km², of which about three quarters are considered productive. Forests cover about a third of the area, but also the lakes {{22}} and Lugano make up a considerable part of the total area. These lakes are known with the above listed names, but are officially named Lake Verbano and Lake Ceresio.\\n\\nThe canton is split geographically in two parts by the Monte Ceneri pass. The northern, more mountainous part, called Sopraceneri, is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around the lake Maggiore:  Ticino Valley and Maggia Valley. The southern part, called Sottoceneri, is the region around the Lake Lugano.\\n\\nThe {{25}} is the largest river in the canton. It drains most of the canton, flowing from the northwest through the Bedretto Valley and the Leventina valley to enter Lake Maggiore near {{28}}. Its main tributaries are the Brenno in the Blenio Valley and the Moesa in the Mesolcina Valley in {{33}}. The lands of the canton are shaped by the river, which in its mid portion forms a wide valley, commonly known as the Riviera. \\n\\nThe western lands of the canton, however, are drained by the Maggia River. The Verzasca Valley is located between the Ticino river and the Maggia river. There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the Lake Lugano. Most of the land is considered within the {{37}}, but a small area is part of the plain of the {{38}} which drains the north of {{39}}.\\n\\nIn ancient times the area of what is today Ticino was settled by the Lepontii, a {{41}}ic tribe. Later, probably around the rule of {{42}}, it became part of the Roman Empire. After the fall of the Western Empire, was ruled by the {{44}}, the Lombards and the {{46}}. Around 1100 CE it was the centre of struggle between the free communes of {{47}} and {{48}}: in the 14th century it was definitively acquired by the Visconti, Dukes of {{50}}. In the {{51}} the {{52}} Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests.\\n\\nThe {{53}} conquered the Leventina Valley in {{55}}. Between {{56}} and {{57}} some of these lands were already annexed by forces from Uri, but subsequently lost. In a second conquest Uri, {{58}} and {{59}} gained the town of {{60}} and the Riviera in {{61}}. Some of the land and the town Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by Uri in {{62}} but lost again in {{63}}. The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation (at that time constituted by 12 cantons). In {{64}} {{65}}, the Maggia Valley, {{67}} and {{68}} were annexed. Subsequently, the upper valley of the {{69}}, from the St. Gotthard to the town of Biasca (Leventina Valley) was part of Canton {{72}}. The remaining territory (Baliaggi Ultramontani, Ennetbergische Vogteien, the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains) was administered by the Twelve Cantons.\\n\\nThe lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered by the Swiss Confederation. (After the battle of Marignano in {{74}} the king of {{75}} {{76}} defeated the Confederates, and they gave up any further conquests.) In February {{77}} an attempt of annexation by the Cisalpine Republic was repelled by a volunteer militia in {{79}}. Between {{80}} and {{81}}, during the {{82}}, the districts of Bellinzona and Lugano were separate cantons, but in {{85}} the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year. During the Napoleonic Wars, many Ticinese (as was the case for other {{86}}) served in Swiss military units allied with the {{87}}.\\n\\nUntil {{88}} the three largest cities, Bellinzona, Lugano and Locarno, alternated as capital of the canton. In {{89}}, however, Bellinzona became the only and permanent capital.\\n\\nThe current constitutionhttp://www.ti.ch/CAN/argomenti/legislaz/rleggi/rl/dati_rl/f/f01_06.htm dates from {{90}}. The previous constitution, heavily modified, dates from {{91}}, nearly 20 years before the constitution of actual Swiss Confederation.\\n\\nThe cantonal {{93}} is the Grand Council (Italian: Gran Consiglio), with 90 members and the government (Consiglio di Stato) has 5 members (Consiglieri di Stato). In the both councils the members are elected with the {{94}} electoral system. The canton sends two deputies to the Swiss Council of States (upper house), and eight deputies to the National Council (lower house).  It's regional capitol is {{98}}.\\n\\nThe main agricultural production is {{99}}, mostly {{100}}, a type of red wine. It is followed by {{101}}, {{102}} and {{103}} production.\\n\\nThe hilly slopes of the canton are used extensively for the production of hydroelectricity. The electricity produced is used at home and sold for export. There is cattle breeding in the northern areas. The production of wine is important in the canton and exported to mainly other areas in {{104}}. The vineyards are mostly concentrated in the southern half of the canton where the climate is warmer. Other agricultural produce includes corn (maize), potatoes, tobacco and vegetables.\\n\\nThe weather in the canton is often inverse to that north of the {{105}}. This, and a warmer climate in general, attracts many tourists from other Swiss cantons. The lakes together with the sunshine are considered attractive. Tourism is the single most important economic factor in the canton.\\n\\nThere is also light industry, mostly concentrated around the three largest towns of Lugano, Locarno and Bellinzona.\\n\\nThe canton is well connected to the rest of Switzerland. There are tunnels underneath the Gotthard massive, both for rail and road. The canton of Grisons (Graubünden) is connected with a direct coach link, whereas the canton of Valais is connected by rail through a tunnel at the Simplon Pass. There are good rail links to {{108}} and {{109}} in {{110}} as well as {{111}} via {{112}} and {{113}}.\\n\\nBecause of the tourist trade there are a number of small railways in scenic areas in the mountains. Winter sports is important, despite being less developed.\\n\\nThere are two major centres of education and research located in the canton of Ticino. The University of Italian speaking Switzerland (USI, Università della Svizzera Italiana) is the only Swiss university teaching in Italian. The University of Applied Sciences of Italian speaking Switzerland (SUPSI, Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana) on the other hand is a professional training college focused on a practical method of teaching in the areas of applied art, economy, social work, technology and production science.\\n\\nThree daily newspapers are published in Ticino: Corriere del Ticino, La Regione, and Giornale del Popolo. These represent the only Italian daily publications in {{118}}.\\n\\nThe official language, and the one used for most written communication, is Italian. In oral communication Western Lombard (Ticinese) varieties, although receding in favour of Italian (especially in the cities of {{124}}, Ascona and {{125}} and among the younger generations), are still well preserved.  These are further subdivided into local variations, with the northern valleys speaking a dialect more closely aligned with Romansch, Switzerland's fourth official language. There is a certain amount of popular literature (poems, comedies, etc.) in Ticinese, and the national radio and televisions trasmit regularly program in Ticinese (mainly comedies).  \\n\\nThe population is mostly Roman Catholic (75%) or Protestant (7%). About 2% each are Orthodox or {{129}}.\\n\\nThe Canton of Ticino is divided into 8 {{130}}s (distretti) and 38 circles (circoli):\\n\\nThere are 195 municipalities in the canton ({{133}}). These municipalities (comuni) are grouped in 38 circoli (circles or sub-districts) which are in turn grouped into districts (distretti). Since late 1990 there is an ongoing project of group some municipalities together (as they are small).\",\n",

       "  'text': 'The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is a contraceptive for women. It is often called birth control pill or simply \"The Pill.\" The pills contain {{1}}s that make the women who take them {{2}}. Women who take the pill will not become {{3}} during {{4}}. When a woman stops taking the pills, she will usually become fertile again. When taken as prescribed, the pills are one of the safest methods of contraception.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, scientists (such as {{5}}) realized that the {{6}} {{7}} stopped women from making {{8}} (stopped ovulation).  After this discovery, the combined oral contraceptive pill was created. The combined oral contraceptive pill has two female hormones: {{9}} and {{10}}. Some oral contraceptive pills have only progesterone. These are often called the \"minipill\".\\n\\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill is thought to be safe and usually works well.\\n\\nIn the United States, the combined oral contraceptive pill was first given to women in 1960. It was a revolutionary breakthrough in contraception for two reasons. First, it is extremely effective at preventing pregnancy if it is used in the right way. Second, it was the first contraceptive to completely separate the act of contraception (in this case the taking of a pill) from sexual intercourse itself. Unlike barrier methods, when a woman is \"on the Pill,\" she and her man are usually not even aware of it during sexual intercourse, which seems and feels very natural. (In fact, it is possible for the woman to be on the pill without her partner even knowing.) The couple can have sex at any time they wish; they don’t need to interrupt foreplay to put birth control in place, and they can feel the physical sensations and emotional closeness of intercourse without interference from a make or female condom. Unlike coitus interruptus, when a woman is on the Pill, intercourse usually ends with her man reaching orgasm while inside the vagina, which both the man and woman usually find very pleasurable. It may also  make women\\'s {{11}} shorter and with less bleeding, as well as helping her complexion, which most women like. For all of these reasons, the Pill is very popular. In 2005, more than  80 million women across the world used the Pill. It is the most common method of contraception in the United States, with four out of five women there having used the pill for birth control at some point in their lives. Use of the Pill is different in different countries, and among women of different ages and levels of education. Both single women and married women use the Pill in large numbers.\\n\\nThe Pill has some slight risks for side effects. It may make a very small increase in the risk of {{12}} in the {{13}}, {{14}}, {{15}}, and {{16}} {{17}}. Most of these risk are small. Some women may experience mood swings, weight gain, or loss of sex drive. Sometimes, but rarely, these side effects are serious enough to make a woman decide to stop using the Pill.\\n\\nThe choices a woman has for contraception - and whether contraception is even available - depends on what country she lives in. These things are different in different countries. In the United Kingdom, one out of every 4 women aged 16–49 were using the Pill as at 2006 (either the combined pill or progestogen only pill (\"minipill\")). compared to only 1% of women in {{19}}. \\n\\nLocal {{20}} and habits may also affect whether or not people use the Pill. \\n\\nIn some countries, women do not really have a choice because only one kind of contraception is available. In some countries (like {{21}}, {{22}}, and {{23}}), the Pill is the most common method offered by national family planning programs.  In other countries, like India, national family planning programs only offer female {{26}} (a surgery which makes a woman unable to ever have children again). Other countries, like {{27}} and {{28}}, only offer the IUD, intrauterine device.\\n\\nThere are two major kinds of oral contraceptive pills. The first kind has both estrogen and progesterone in it. The other only has progesterone (these are called progesterone-only pills, or POPs). The pills do not actually have natural hormones in them. Instead, they have other {{30}}s that are mostly the same as the hormones, but have been made in a laboratory. \\n\\nSome women can only take one kind of COCP. For example, estrogen stops the {{32}} from producing milk. Because of this, women who are {{33}} should not take pills that have estrogen in them. There are also some other types of women who should not be given estrogen. These women should only use progesterone-only pills.\\n\\nWhile there are just two major kinds of birth control pills (COCPs and POPs), there are many different brands or versions of each kind of pill. Every brand of COCP will have the same hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in it. However, each brand has a different amount of hormones in it. Also, some brands change the amount of hormones given from week to week.\\n\\nThere are two ways to measure how well COCPs work. (Most forms of birth control are also measured in these two ways.):\\nTo show how well the Pill works, scientists figure out rates of effectiveness (for perfect use and for actual/typical use). These rates show how many women are kept from getting pregnant by the Pill. Rates of effectiveness usually look at how well the Pill works during the first year that women are using the Pill. Most often, the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates. However, some studies use decrement tables.\\n\\nThe typical use pregnancy rate for women taking COCPs measures how many women get pregnant while taking COCPs. All women are not equally likely to get pregnant while taking COCPs. Different groups of women have different typical use pregnancy rates. Overall, between 2% and 8% of women taking COCPs get pregnant every year. If COCPs are used perfectly, only 0.3% become pregnant each year.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why women do not use the Pill perfectly. Because of these things, typical use effectiveness is lower than perfect use effectiveness.\\n\\nCOCPs can prevent pregnancy if the first pill is taken no later than 5 days after a woman starts {{37}}. If the treatment is started at any other time in the {{38}}, COCPs cannot safely prevent pregnancy for the first 7 days of use. During this time, a woman needs to use other types of contraception in order to prevent pregnancy. When active pills have been taken for 7 days, COCPs can work well to prevent pregnancy. COCPs should be taken at about the same time every day.\\n\\nCertain things can make COCPs not work as well:\\n\\nSome other {{39}}s can interact with COCPs and make them not work as well. These medicines can also cause breakthrough bleeding (where a woman bleeds between her periods). Some of these medicines are:\\n\\nThe traditional medicinal herb St. John\\'s Wort also seems to make COCPs not work as well. This is because of the way St. John\\'s Wort affects the {{41}}.\\n\\nThe Pill can be used for other things besides contraception. There are many medical conditions that are caused by problems with hormone levels. Because the Pill has hormones in it, it can treat these conditions. Some of these conditions are:\\nIf a woman\\'s menstrual cycle is not regular, the Pill can make the woman menstruate on a regular schedule. The Pill can also be used to treat certain problems that cause bleeding from the {{42}}.\\n\\nWomen who use combined oral contraceptives are less likely to get {{43}}. If a woman takes Pill for five years, her risk for getting ovarian cancer is cut in half. Women taking the Pill are also only half as likely to get {{44}} than women who have never taken the Pill. The longer a woman uses the Pill, the more her risk of getting endometrial cancer drops. However, women who take the Pill have a higher risk of getting breast cancer and {{46}}.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Anarcho-primitivism is a form of {{0}} that is critical of the progress of {{1}} {{2}}.\\n\\n{{3}}\\'s work was very influential to early green anarchists. He supported {{5}} and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings as a way to fight the growth of {{7}} civilization.\\n\\nIn the late 1800\\'s, anarchist naturism appeared as the union of {{9}} and {{10}} ideas. The movement was influenced by Thoreau, {{11}} and {{12}}. The movement supported {{13}}, {{14}}, {{15}} and an ecological view of the world. Followers viewed nudism as a way of avoiding the {{16}} of the industrial modern society. Most of the followers were in Spain, France and Portugal.\\n\\nAnarcho-primitivists believe that before the widespread use of {{17}}, humans lived in {{18}} {{19}} tribes. They believe that after the introduction of agriculture, humans slowly began to become \\nobsessed with {{20}}, and {{21}} began to cause inequality. Primitivists disagree about whether we should return to hunter-gatherer tribes, use permaculture, or both.\\n\\nPrimitivists believe, based on {{23}} studies, that hunter-gatherer societies are less likely to have {{24}}, {{25}}, and {{26}}. Not all anthropologists believe this, however. A notable example would be {{27}}, who believes that tribe-based people are more prone to violence than developed states.\\n\\nAnarchists are against strong government control, and strive for {{29}} relationships with others. However, Anarcho-primitivists go beyond and apply this to all life, not just human life. Anarcho-primitivists look at the history of human civilization in order to decide how to achieve their goals. They are influenced by the Luddites, and are generally against {{31}}. Anarcho-primitivists appreciate the {{32}}, and believe that humans are damaging it.\\n\\nPrimitivists do not believe that a mass society can be free. They believe that the {{34}} that these industrial societies produce lead to people relying on factories and other people to make their food, clothing, shelter, etc.; thus, forcing them to be a member of the society.\\n\\nA common criticism of the Anarcho-primitivist movement is hypocrisy. Critics say that while Primitivists reject civilization, they usually live civilized lives and use technology to spread their message. Primitivists like John Zerzan say that using technology is a necessary evil for continuing to promote and discuss important conversations.\\n\\nA notable primitivist, Derrick Jensen, rejects the term \"primitivism,\" believing that it is {{38}} way to describe the {{39}}. He now prefers to be called a \"indigenist\" or an \"ally to the indigenous.\"\\n\\nAnarchists Wolfi Landstreicher and Jason McQuinn both criticize the movement as {{41}} exaggerations of indigenous societies. They also claim that Primitivists use the {{42}} {{43}} often. In response, Primitivist John Zerzan says that the movement is not romanticizing the indigenous people. It is instead promoting the \"mainstream view presented in anthropology and archeology textbooks for the past few decades. It sounds utopian, but it\\'s now the generally accepted {{44}}.\"',\n",

These were made at Abbey Road Studios during the 1960s.\\n\\nMartin grew up playing {{7}} with only a few music lessons. He began to compose music in his teens. Martin played with his own {{8}} called the Four Tune-Tellers. He {{9}}ed of one day making {{10}} music for {{11}}s.\\n\\nAfter serving in the {{12}} during {{13}}, Martin went to music {{14}}. After he {{15}}, he worked for the BBC in {{17}}. He began working for {{18}} in 1950. Martin became an assistant at {{19}}, a small record label. Parlophone mostly recorded classical music and original cast recordings of popular stage shows and {{24}}.\\n\\nMartin later became the chief of Parlophone Records. He was also its staff {{25}}. Martin was in charge of recording sessions and chose {{26}}s for Parlophone {{27}} to record. He made {{28}} records (often working with {{29}} and {{30}}) along with his usual jobs, to help promote the label. When rock and roll became popular in the mid-1950s, Martin began looking for rock groups or artists to join Parlophone. He recorded several such artists, but none of their {{32}} became big hits.\\n\\nIn 1962, Beatles manager {{33}} brought Martin a demo (demonstration record) of his band. Epstein had been trying for months to get the band a recording contract. Martin liked what he heard. He saw that the young band were willing to try different things, and gave them an audition (a studio tryout). All the Beatles passed their audition, except for their drummer, {{35}}. Martin was not happy with the skills Best showed. He wanted to replace Best on their recordings. When the band found out, they fired Best, replacing him with {{36}}. Starr had played with them before when Best could not be with them to play. Martin used a studio drummer on their first {{38}}, \"Love Me Do\". He did this because there was no time to audition Starr before the record had to be made, but he never did so again.\\n\\nWith Starr as their drummer, and Martin as their producer (who sometimes joined them in playing, to give the records a bigger sound), the Beatles became the most popular act in the history of show business. While Beatles {{40}} and {{41}} wrote most of the band\\'s songs, they were musically untrained, as Martin had been earlier. Martin helped develop their musical ideas. He helped the band learn to talk to other musicians about the sounds they wanted to make, and added a classical touch to many of their songs. His work with them made Martin famous. He was able to leave EMI to become a \"producer for hire\". He started his own {{42}}, called Associated Independent Recording (AIR), with some other producers.\\n\\nWhen the Beatles began to break up in 1969, Martin felt the {{43}} between the band\\'s members. He was sometimes  for not being able to \"fix things\", or solve their problems. He began turning down sessions with the band. He let the {{45}} or the members themselves do his job. Martin returned to help make their last album (titled Abbey Road after the location of the studio), after all the Beatles promised to work with him \"like the old days\", and let Martin take charge of the sessions once more.\\n\\nPaul McCartney, the most \"conventional\" (normal) Beatle, worked with Martin several times after the Beatles ended in 1970. John Lennon counted on Martin to turn his sometimes \"way-out\" ideas into finished records, but he did not always like the way Martin worked, and mostly produced his own solo recordings. {{48}}, the youngest Beatle, found many of his songs and ideas rejected by Martin. Martin later said \"I was always rather beastly to George,\" in trying to make more hit records. Harrison also produced (or co-produced) most of his own solo work. He even built his own recording studio after years of making records at Abbey Road. Martin praised Ringo Starr\\'s \"super-steady beat\", and the sound his {{49}}s gave the Beatles records, but each later worked with other people.\\n\\nEven years after they broke up, Martin still worked with and for the Beatles and the music they had made together. He {{50}}ed many of their recordings for re-issues and {{51}}. He made several records of his own with classical and {{52}}l versions of Beatles tunes, and was the music producer for Sergeant Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, a {{54}} {{55}} based on their songs, which starred the {{56}} and {{57}}.\\n\\nBesides the Beatles, Martin worked with other recording artists, including {{58}}, {{59}}, America, {{61}}, {{62}}, and Little River Band. He wrote a {{64}}, All You Need is Ears, that told his life story and explained how many of his most famous recordings were made. During the {{65}}, Martin was made a {{66}} by the {{67}} {{68}}, for his work and his role in popular music.\\n\\nMartin retired in 1999, and released an album titled In My Life, which featured many different artists performing Beatles songs. The album included non-musicians like {{69}} {{70}}.\\n\\nMartin died in his sleep on the night of 8 March 2016 at his house. He was aged 90.

       "  'text': 'A monopoly (from the Greek monos, one + polein, to sell) is when a {{1}} or {{2}} can only be bought from one supplier for a specific {{3}}.  If other firms serve the market, they may be too small compared to the largest, thus allowing the large firm to have a lot of market power. A monopoly usually happens when there is no economic {{5}} to produce the product or service and there is no available substitutes to the product or service.\\n\\nIn economics, a monopoly is a single producer of a product or service. In law, a monopoly is a firm that has a lot of market power and is able to charge very high prices for a product or service. As long as the firm has a lot of market power, it does not matter if the firm is large or small, as size is not used to decide if a firm is a monopoly.\\n\\nA monopoly can be formed by the government, by merging a few firms to form a large one, or form naturally to become a {{6}}. In many places, {{7}} such as [telephone] service or {{8}} are monopolies, as it is very costly to build the {{9}} for another firm to compete in the market. Such natural monopolies is hence allowed by the government, but is usually strictly controlled to prevent the monopoly from charging a very high price for a product or service.\\n\\nMany countries, including the {{10}}, have laws to stop companies from having a monopoly or to limit the actions that they can do as a monopoly.\\n\\nIn {{11}}, a monopoly does this:\\n\\nA monopoly is a type of firm that wants to make its profits as big as possible, and as the market does not have any other large firms, the monopoly is able to set prices on their products or services. Hence, the monopoly would set a price that would maximize the profits that they gain, but cause the consumers to have to pay more for the same good.\\n\\nFor all types of firms (including monopoly), firms make their profits biggest at the output level in which the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves meet, known as the profit maximizing output. But when a firm is a monopoly, the price that the firm sets is the price level of the demand curve for that amount of output. However, it is better for society if the output level is when the marginal cost and the demand curve meet, which is of a higher output and a lower price than what the monopoly produces. Hence, since society could be better if more of the good is produced, a deadweight loss is created. A monopoly is hence not allocatively efficient.\\n\\nDepending on the total cost that the monopoly has, a monopoly may be able to earn supernormal profits in the long run. This thus allows the monopoly to have money to do costly {{15}} or become more cost efficient in producing the products or services. However, there are people who believe that a monopoly may become complacent and not do innovation at all as there is no competition in the market.\\n\\nA natural monopoly can happen when there is very high barriers to entry that it is not profitable for more firms to enter the market for the level of demand that is present in the market. A natural monopoly keeps getting increasing economies of scale for the level of demand in the market, and relatively high fixed costs. The average cost of production would then keep decreasing for the whole demand of the product or service. It is thus cheaper for a single firm to produce the product or service, as it would not be profitable for two or more firms to be in the market.\\n\\nA natural monopoly is similar to a normal monopoly and can be inefficient. Hence, governments tend to make laws that controls what the natural monopoly does, mainly to set prices at an affordable level.',\n",

We say that the tradition is “{{4}}ly transmitted” or “handed down orally”, meaning that the music is not written down but taught by speaking (“oral” means “belonging to the mouth”). Every country has its own traditional music. {{5}} is part of folk music. A folksinger is a person who sings folk songs.\\n\\nIn the {{7}} a new type of music was started by a book  {{8}} who mixed traditional folk song with rock and roll. This music is sometimes called “folk rock” . \\n\\nFolk music is music for everybody to play and listen to. In this way it is different from classical music which is mainly developed by {{11}} musicians for a smaller group of people. Folk music is part of a popular {{12}}, although the term “popular music” or “{{13}}” today refers to a kind of music which people can hear through [television], {{14}} and other means of recording.\\n\\nIn many parts of the world nearly all music is folk music. The term “folk music” is usually used for European and American music which is part of an oral tradition. Folk music as an oral tradition, is much less important than before, in part because of new {{15}} (radio, television etc, and {{17}} of music ). Folk tunes are now often written down, and they have {{18}}d other kinds of music, so that the differences between various types of music are harder to see. X was here\\n\\nIn older times folk music was part of “communal recreation”. This means that small communities such as {{19}}s or {{20}} would relax by playing and singing music together. People would often make up a new song or new piece of music, or make changes to music that they already knew. In this way music was always changing. People would get musical ideas from other groups nearby. This is why folk music from neighbouring {{21}} often sound similar.\\n\\n{{22}}s were a popular kind of folk music. These were folk songs which told a story (they were “narrative”). Sometimes they had a refrain after each verse so that everybody could join in. Ballads told stories of love, {{23}}s or folklore. This is how stories were handed down from one {{24}} to another.\\n\\nInstrumental folk music was used for {{25}}. Some of the instruments may have been very simple, such as a pair of sticks, {{26}} or a simple {{27}}. Other instruments may include fiddle (the folk word for “{{28}}”), {{29}}, {{30}}, {{31}}, or various {{32}}s, depending on the time of history and the country.\\n\\nSome singing was {{33}}, i.e. there were two or more parts (voices). Very often two voices would sing in parallel (going up and down together). In countries such as {{34}} people sang in three or four parts, e.g. in the tradition of “podgolosnaya” (“underneath the voice”). In countries such as {{35}} this polyphonic tradition did not exist. Folk songs there were sung by one singer, unaccompanied.\\n\\nFolk music used different {{36}}. These are called {{37}}. The Ionian mode (like our major scale) was the most common in Western Europe. In some parts of Eastern Europe modes with several {{38}}s were used, but for the most part, half steps were avoided. This results is the tunes being described as tetratonic (four notes per octave) or pentatonic (five notes per octave).\\n\\nFolk music also includes simple children’s songs and {{39}}.\\n\\nFolk music was sung by people as they worked. In the early days of European immigration in {{40}} the pioneers sang as they travelled, {{42}}s sang as they worked, {{43}}s sang in the {{44}}fields.\\n\\nIn the {{45}} folk music started to have an influence on classical music (or “art music”). People from the higher classes started to be interested in folk music because they were conscious of being part of a tradition. Composers such as {{46}} and {{47}} wrote folk dances for {{48}}s or small groups of instruments.\\n\\nFolk music was used by many composers in the {{49}} period. {{50}} used folk song in a lot of his music. In the early twentieth century some composers travelled around collecting folk music which was being played or sung by people in the country. They often used some of these ideas in their music. {{51}} did this in {{52}} as well as in {{53}} and in the {{54}}, and people such as Cecil Sharp and the composer {{56}} collected folk music in {{57}}.

       "  'text': 'Premature birth is when a {{0}} is born before the normal end of {{1}}. In humans, a pregnancy normally lasts for about nine months. On {{2}}, a pregnancy lasts for 266 days.\\n\\nBabies who are born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy (calculated from the last {{3}}) are said to be premature. In the {{4}}, about twelve percent of the babies are born prematurely (that is about one in every eight babies). In 2003, there were over 490,000 premature births. \\n\\nWorldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to get. In {{5}}, there is often no professional medical care for these babies. This makes it difficult to tell how far along the pregnancy really was. For this reason, the {{6}} tracks rates of low birth weight instead. In 2000, 16.5 percent of babies born in developing countries were of low birth weight. It is estimated that one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery.\\n\\nThe risk of having a problem (called a {{8}}) is higher in shorter pregnancies. Babies born prematurely die more often in their first year of life than others. Most such deaths occur in the first month of life, which is called neonatal mortality.  \\n\\nWorldwide, prematurity causes ten percent of neonatal mortality, or around 500,000 deaths per year. In the U.S., where many {{9}} and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%. Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk of developing serious health problems, such as {{10}}, chronic lung disease, {{12}} problems, {{13}}, {{14}}, or {{15}}.  They are also more likely to have {{16}} as teenagers.\\n\\nNearly half of all premature births have no known cause. When conditions permit, doctors may attempt to stop premature labor, so that the pregnancy can have a chance to continue to full term. This will increase the baby\\'s chances of health and survival. \\n\\nIn the United States, the rate of preterm births has increased 30% in the past two {{18}}.\\n\\nIn developed countries, many {{19}}s have special facilities for prematurely born infants. This type of hospital unit is usually called a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU, {{20}} \"NICK-you\"). In the NICU, premature babies are kept warm in {{21}}s or other warming machines. They are enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment which keeps them warm and keeps {{22}} away from them.  \\n\\nModern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of {{23}}, {{24}}, {{25}} function, {{26}} supply, and {{27}} activity. Treatments may include {{28}} and {{29}} given through {{30}} catheters; {{32}}, breathing support; and {{34}}. \\n\\nIn developing countries, where advanced equipment may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as kangaroo care (skin-to-skin warming), encouraging {{35}}, and basic infection control measures help reduce death rate and illness.\\n\\nThe earliest time in the pregnancy where the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is called the limit of viability. In countries with good health care, viability has been reduced to about 24 weeks. Rare survivors have been documented as early as 21 weeks, but this date is {{36}} because the pregnancy was measured from the date of conception rather than the date of her mother\\'s last menstrual period. This makes gestation appear 2 weeks less than if calculated by the more common method. Risk of {{37}} and {{38}} is significant at that early time. Even if the infant lives, there are {{39}} controversies over the care given to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the {{40}} debate.',\n",

The six-member Board is composed of the President of the PLM, a representative of the PLM faculty, a distinguished alumnus, a respected educator, and one other respected professional, and the Superintendent of the Division of City Schools-Manila. Each member serves a six-year tenure of office. The President oversees the implementation of the university policies. Immediately under the President are the offices of four Vice-Presidents - Executive Vice President, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Administration, and Vice President for Finance and Planning.\\n   \\n\\nThe University is organized into twelve undergraduate colleges, two professional schools, seven graduate schools, and an open university and distance learning program, which are all being supervised by the Executive Vice President. These academic units collectively provide 53 single-degree undergraduate and 49 masters, doctoral and graduate diploma programs.\\n\\nThe twelve undergraduate colleges are the {{19}}, College of Architecture & Urban Planning, {{21}}, {{22}}, {{23}}, {{24}}, {{25}}, {{26}}, {{27}}, {{28}}, {{29}}, and {{30}}. The two professional schools are the {{31}} and the {{32}}. The seven graduate schools include Graduate School of Arts, Sciences & Education, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Engineering, Graduate School of Law, Graduate School of Management, Graduate School of Urban & Settlements Planning, and the President Ramon Magsaysay School of Public Governance. The university\\'s open university and distance learning program is served through the Emeritus College, Open University, and the District Colleges.\\n\\nPLM is the tenth largest university in {{43}} with a total student enrollment of 13,711 (as of January 20, 2006). For the undergraduate class of 2011, PLM received 40,000 college applications, and accepted three percent of them.\\n\\nPLM\\'s endowment in 2008 was valued at PhP 500 million, excluding the funding allotted for its teaching hospital, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, of about PhP 250 million. The University spends about four to fives times the national average for education. \\n\\nPLM utilizes a semester-based {{48}} system for conducting courses, adopts features of the American system (credits), and employs the {{50}} (GWA) system and a 1.00 to 5.00 grading scale, with 1.00 being the highest possible grade for a particular undergraduate course.\\n\\nThe semestral calendar being used by PLM consists of two regular semesters of about 15 to 16 weeks each, and semestral breaks of about three to four weeks each. The university requires a minimum of twelve units to be considered a full-time student, with the maximum being twenty units.\\n\\nThe late President, Diosdado Macapagal, who himself visited the University, said that PLM is \"a unique university because it is the first community-oriented and socially conscious university in the country.\" He added that, \"it gives poor but deserving public high school graduates of the community the means to acquire higher education.\" Moreover, he recognized PLM\\'s emerging status as \"one of the top universities in the country.\" Her daughter, President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo cited PLM for having a \"culture of excellence,\" and commended the university for what she had believed as its \"impressive\" accomplishments in various fields. \\n\\nThe country\\'s leading newspaper, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, described PLM as a local university with a national character and reputation. US Ambassador Kristie Kenney, in her speech during the 40th  Commencement Exercises at the PLM Grandstand, praised PLM for building a \"culture of commitment to public service in its students, faculty and alumni.\" In an article in the Business Mirror, PLM was considered as the \"highest symbol of Manila’s public educational system which radiates another form of power and influence.\" Websites such as Manila Board regarded that PLM is one of leading and prime public universities in the country today.\\n\\nOn August 13, 2008, {{52}}, in his column at the Manila Times wrote that PLM is \"a unique learning institution\" and is \"essentially an honors school where only the students from lower income families with excellent scholastic records are admitted.\"\\n\\nPLM is not a perfect institution, and the university had been criticized in the past for the \\'reconsideration\\' cases, wherein some students who failed to meet the university’s standards for retention were readmitted because of the so-called \\'backers\\'. In order to resolve this issue, the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the country\\'s leading educational institutions.[1] [2]\\n\\nThe site of the PLM campus at {{53}} used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila (also known as Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio), which was founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio  Sedeño, S.J.  The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595, and was the first school in the Philippines.\\n\\nAside from Colegio de Manila, there were other structures that were built in the site. Iglesia de Santa Ana, the first stone church in the Philippines, was built in 1590 and opened in 1596. However, an earthquake destroyed it, and another church was built in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1626.\\n\\nIn 1601, the Colegio de San José was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university.  In 1623, Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia.  In 1722, the Colegio de San José was granted royal patronage. \\n\\nIn 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories.  Later, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the {{54}}. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the {{55}}. The Colegio de San José is now the San José Major Seminary at the {{56}}.\\n\\nThe buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, which eventually became known as Cuartel de España. José Rizal was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26, 1896.\\n\\nDuring the American occupation, part of the barracks was razed, and a gymnasium was built on it. In early 1930s, one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym.  The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941. During {{57}}, General Douglas McArthur held command post here, but the entire area was later destroyed by the ongoing military conflict.\\n\\nIn early 1960s, the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School. However, on April 24, 1965, the late {{58}} Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392-A, giving to the proposed city university the three-hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School. On February 26, 1967, the new complex along Victoria Street was inaugurated, and the students of Manila High School was transferred there. On July 17, 1967, the first group of PLM scholars began studying on the site where the modern educational system in the Philippines started.\\n\\nThe call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13, 1960. The said ordinance allotted a total of {{59}} 1,000,000 for the construction of the university. However, Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack. Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacson\\'s plan. He later issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university. But some difficulty prevented the university\\'s formal creation. As a result, he sought the help of Congressman Justo R. Albert, representative of the City\\'s fourth congressional district. Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No. 8349 at the Philippines\\' House of Representatives. The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias.\\n\\nThe two bills were eventually combined into one, and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25, 1965. The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress and signed by Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos and House Speaker Cornelio T. Villareal with Mr. Regino S. Eustaquio, Secretary of the Senate, and Mr. Inocencio B. Pareja, Secretary of the House of Representatives.\\n\\nOn June 19, 1965, the final bill with the title - \"An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes\" - was signed into law by President Diosdado P. Macapacal in a signing ceremony at {{60}}. The signing was witnessed by Atty. Primitivo de Leon, Mayor Villegas, Congressman Ramon Mitra Jr., and its main sponsor in the House of Representatives, Congressman Albert. The law was captioned as Republic Act No. 4196, which now serves as the University Charter.\\n\\nWith an enrollment of 556 students—both men and women—PLM opened for classes on July 17, 1967. All of them are housed under the University College, which offered liberal arts courses. After a year, a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded, and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies. At the turn of the decade, the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication, engineering, education, business administration, nursing.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Tropical Storm Gamma was the twenty-fourth named storm of the {{0}}. Gamma formed in the eastern {{1}} but quickly died a few days later from {{2}}. On {{3}}, it restrengthened and became a tropical storm for a few more days before dying off the coast of {{4}} on {{5}}. Although Gamma never made any landfall, it caused minor damages in the {{6}} and medium damages in Honduras.\\n\\nThe {{7}} began monitoring a {{8}} that would later become Gamma around {{9}}, but the system did not develop into a tropical depression until after it had passed the {{10}} on {{11}}. At that time, the storm was called Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven and was predicted to strengthen into a strong tropical storm or a weak hurricane as it moved across the {{12}}. However, a second system developing in the southwestern edge of the Caribbean began pushing {{13}} onto the depression on {{14}}, then weakening the depression into a tropical low; advisories were then temporarily stopped. On later reanalysis, it was found that the depression had probably become a tropical storm by {{15}} at 0600 UTC for less than 6 hours, but was not named during the time.\\n\\nAs the remnants of Twenty-Seven moved west, the system in the southwestern Caribbean moved onto land in {{16}} and quickly weakened, reducing wind shear on the remnant low. Near {{17}}, the two systems combined and rapidly gained the  characteristics of a tropical cyclone on {{18}}, when it was upgraded directly to a tropical storm and given the name Gamma. It is clearly unknown whether the remnant low of Gamma absorbed the low pressure system or happened the other way, but forecasters at the National Hurricane Center though that it was more likely that Gamma absorbed the other system. (If it were determined to be the other way around, the previously mentioned Tropical Storm Twenty-Seven would have been a separate and unnamed tropical storm.)\\n\\nGamma strengthened a little bit more to reach its maximum strength of 50 {{19}} (85 {{20}}) winds during that day, but a trough moving into the {{21}} stopped any more strengthening. Gamma stayed just north of the coast of Honduras for about a day, then weakened to a tropical depression as it was beginning to be absorbed into the front as it entered the Caribbean. On {{22}}, wind shear had destroyed Gamma and advisories were stopped, although the low level circulation of Gamma survived for an extra 36–48 hours. Later, the last remnants of Gamma were absorbed into the approaching front. Gamma never made landfall as a tropical storm.\\n\\nBecause the storm was not predicted to make landfall (and it did not), few preparations were taken in Honduras for the storm. But non-stop rainfall for more than a day as Gamma wandered offshore created {{23}}s that forced more than 23,000 people to leave their homes.\\n\\nAs of {{24}} {{25}}, a total of forty-one people were reported dead (while thirty-seven killed directly) as a result of Tropical Storm Gamma, mostly in Honduras, with 13 missing in Honduras.\\n\\nThirty-four people died in {{26}} with at least thirteen other people missing. All deaths were because of flooding and {{27}}s rather than wind damage since tropical storm-force winds did not affect the mainland.\\n\\nAccording to the COCEP (the Honduran civil emergency committee) dozens of bridges were washed away and about 2,000 homes were destroyed. According to the NHC, 10 bridges were destroyed from flooding, and 7 were damaged. And 5,200 acres worth of {{28}} crops were also destroyed, causing $13-18 million (2005 USD) in damage. In addition, an unofficial report of 4.44 inches of rain was reported on Roatan Island.\\n\\nFive fishermen who were at sea during Tropical Storm Gamma have been reported missing and, as of {{31}}, were thought to be dead after five unidentified bodies were found on the Honduran coast. Three people were killed in a plane crash from Gamma's outer rain bands; it was thought that the weather was a part of the reason. Other effects to Belize were minimal.\\n\\nTwo people were killed by a {{32}} in {{33}} from Tropical Depression Twenty-Seven (which would eventually become Tropical Storm Gamma) when the system came close to the island. Seven homes were also destroyed by flood waters in the area and others were damaged.\\n\\nOther effects across the rest of the {{34}} were minimal and were no worse than that of a normal rain event. Also, two fishermen who were reported dead in {{35}} were thought to have been killed by Gamma.\\n\\nAfter Gamma slowly moved away from land, Honduran government officials carried out helicopter rescues for people and families trapped by flood waters, as UN agencies began airlifting food and water to the impacted areas http://usunrome.usmission.gov/UNIssues/sustdev/docs/a5120503.htm.\\n\\nThe government of {{37}}, in {{38}}, donated 40 million lempiras to aid in disaster efforts, and the {{40}} sent helicopters to help in the delivery of food to the people affected by the storm.\\n\\nBecause damage was minimal, Gamma was not retired and will be used again whenever the regular list of names is all used up in the future.\\n\\nAfter all of the twenty one assigned {{41}} for the 2005 season were used up after {{42}}, the {{43}} was used, starting with {{44}}. This storm was named {{45}} once it was known to have reached {{46}} strength (after it restrengthened). This was the first time that the name Gamma had been used for a {{47}}.\\n\\nBecause Gamma was the only twenty-fourth tropical storm to form in any single Atlantic hurricane season, Gamma also holds the record for being the earliest twenty-fourth tropical storm, reaching tropical storm strength on {{48}}. Gamma also extended the 2005 season's record for tropical storms to twenty-four, which was also enlarged four more times and ended at twenty-eight storms after {{49}} and a post-season addition of an unnamed subtropical storm which went originally unnoticed in October. Also, Gamma tied the record set during the {{50}} for most storms in a single basin monitored by {{51}}.\",\n",

He was known as Cato Minor to distinguish him from his great-grandfather ({{4}}). A noted {{5}}, he had great moral integrity. He could not be {{6}}, and disliked the political {{7}} of the age. He is remembered for his stubbornness and for his lengthy conflict with {{8}}.\\n\\n{{9}} tells a story about Cato\\'s {{10}}\\' immense respect for him, even at a young age. During a Roman ritual military game, called \"Troy\", in which all aristocratic teenagers participated as a sort of \"coming of age\" ceremony, a mock battle with wooden weapons was performed on horseback. While the child of one of Sulla\\'s surrogates was chosen by the adult organizers to lead one of the \"teams,\" the team refused to follow him because of his character, and when they were finally asked whom they would follow, the boys unanimously chose Cato.\\n\\nAs a {{11}}, Cato was sent to {{12}} in 67 BC at the age of 28. He was given command of a {{13}}. He led his men from the front, sharing their work, food, and sleeping quarters. He was strict in discipline and punishment but was popular with his {{14}}. When in {{15}}, he got the news that his brother Caepio was dying in {{16}}. He set off to see him but his brother died before he arrived. Cato was overwhelmed by grief and, for once, he spared no expense to organize lavish funeral ceremonies.\\n\\nOn his return to Rome in 65 BC, Cato was elected to the position of {{17}}. One of his first moves was to prosecute former quaestors for misusing funds and dishonesty. Cato also prosecuted {{18}}\\'s informers, who had acted as head-hunters during Sulla\\'s dictatorship. Cato did this even when the men were well connected politically. At the end of the year, Cato stepped down from his quaestorship amid popular acclaim, but he never ceased to keep an eye on the treasury, always looking for irregularities.\\n\\nAs senator, Cato was scrupulous and determined. He never missed a session of the Senate and publicly criticized those who did so. From the beginning, he aligned himself with the Optimates, the conservative faction of the Senate. Many of the Optimates at this time had been Sulla\\'s personal friends, whom Cato had despised since his youth, yet Cato attempted to make his name by returning his faction to its pure republican roots.\\n\\nIn 63 BC, he was elected {{20}} for the following year. He helped the {{21}}, {{22}}, deal with the Catiline conspiracy. Lucius Sergius Catilina, a noble patrician, led a rebellion against the state, raising an army in {{26}}. \\n\\nWhen Cicero discovered a plot against the consuls and other magistrates in Rome, he arrested the conspirators. Cicero proposed to execute them without trial (which was not lawful). In the Senate\\'s discussion, {{27}} agreed the conspirators were guilty, but argued for distributing them among Italian cities \"for safekeeping\". In contrast, Cato argued that capital punishment was necessary to deter treason: it was folly to wait for the test of the conspirators\\' guilt. Convinced by Cato\\'s argument, the Senate approved Cicero\\'s proposal, and  the conspirators were executed. Most of Catilina\\'s army quit the field, much as Cato had predicted.\\n\\nCato was a supporter of {{28}}, and continued the fight after Pompey was dead. The anti-Caesar forces, known as the Optimates (roughly, the \"Good Guys\") were reinforced by forces from local rulers. They numbered about eight legions (40.000 men) plus sixty elephants. Caesar defeated the Optimates at the Battle of Thapsus in modern {{30}}, {{31}}. Cato did not actually take part in the battle, which was led by a colleague, and committed {{32}} after the defeat. Roughly 10,000 enemy soldiers wanted to surrender to Caesar, but were instead slaughtered by Caesar\\'s army. This was unusual for Caesar, who was known as a merciful victor.

His father, Dana C. Schmidt, was a fisheries biologist. When he was 13, his family moved to {{10}}.\\n\\nSchmidt went to Bartlett High School in Anchorage, and graduated in 1985. He has said that he wanted to be a {{12}} \"since I was about five-years-old\" but \"... I did some work at the US National Weather Service up in Anchorage and didn\\'t enjoy it very much. It was less scientific, not as exciting as I thought it would be - there was a lot of routine. But I guess I was just a little naive about what being a meteorologist meant.\" He decided to study astronomy just before he started at university. He was graduated BS(Physics), BS(Astronomy) from the {{13}} in 1989. He received his MA (1992) and then {{14}} from {{15}} in 1993. Schmidt\\'s PhD thesis was supervised by Robert Kirshner and used {{17}} to measure the {{18}}.\\n \\nAt Harvard, he met his future wife, an Australian, Jenny Gordon who was studying for a PhD in {{19}}. In 1994, he moved to Australia.\\n\\nSchmidt was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (1993-94) before moving to {{21}} in the {{22}} in 1995. \\n\\nSchmidt and Adam Riess led the High-z Supernova Search Team which found evidence that the Universe\\'s expansion rate is now {{25}}. They discovered this by looking at Type 1a Supernova. The discovery was the opposite of the current theory that the expansion of the universe was slowing down. By studying the color shifts in the light from the supernova from Earth, they discovered that these billion-year old nova were still accelerating. This result was also found about the same time by the Supernova Cosmology Project, led by Saul Perlmutter. With two studies getting the same result scientists now accept the accelerating universe theory. New research is now trying to understand the nature of the universe, such as the existence of {{29}}. The discovery of the accelerating universe was named \\'Breakthrough of the Year\\' by Science Magazine in 1998. Schmidt was jointly awarded the 2011 {{30}} along with Reiss and Perlmutter for their groundbreaking work.\\n\\nSchmidt is currently leading the SkyMapper telescope Project and the associated Southern Sky Survey.\\n\\nSchmidt has received the Australian Governments Malcolm McIntosh Prize in 2000, {{33}}\\'s Bok Prize in 2000, the {{34}} Pawsey Medal Medal in 2001, and the Vainu Bappu Medal of the Astronomical Society of India in 2002. He was the Marc Aaronson Memorial Lecturer in 2005, and in 2006, he shared the Shaw Prize in {{38}} with Adam Riess and Saul Perlmutter.\\n\\nSchmidt and the other members of the High-Z Team (the set defined by the co-authors of Riess et al. 1998) shared the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize, a $500,000 award, with Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Supernova Cosmology Project (the set defined by the co-authors of Perlmutter et al. 1999) for their discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe.\\n\\nSchmidt, along with Riess and Perlmutter, jointly won the 2011 {{43}} for their observations which led to the discovery of the accelerating Universe.',\n",

He won the 2010 Auckland mayoral election on 9 October 2010 and was sworn in as mayor of Auckland on 1 November 2010.\\n\\nHe was born in Taumarunui, and his family moved to Otara in {{7}} when he was seven years old. He attended Mayfield Primary School, Papatoetoe Intermediate School and De La Salle College. He has fond memories of his early life, saying \"they were generous, generous days\". His life growing up has been described as centred on family, church, school and community, while parents Tom and Ngaire were described as strong believers in social equity and social justice as well as active in the community life. While he did not grow up in Auckland, his family often travelled to see relatives there, because his parents had moved to Taumarunui from South Auckland.\\n\\nBrown worked as a lawyer. He was a partner at law firm Wynyard Wood, and co-founded the Howick Free Legal Service.\\n\\nHe was first elected to the Manukau City council in 1992, and continued as councillor until 2004 when he did not run for re-election. He  was also the chairperson of the Counties Manukau Health Council from 1998. Brown first ran for mayor of Manukau in 2004, and narrowly lost to long serving mayor Sir Barry Curtis; he lost by fewer than 600 votes. Brown had considered requesting a re-count due to the closeness of the vote, but decided that he had not been close enough to warrant it. Despite his affiliation with the {{11}} since age 17, Brown did not run for election in the 2005 General Election, and instead returned to working for Wynyard Wood.\\n\\nBrown announced that he was running to be the Mayor of Manukau in 2006. Barry Curtis announced that he would not be running for re-election, and Brown\\'s main opposition were former Olympic runner Dick Quax and radio host Willie Jackson. Brown resigned from Wynard Wood in 2007 to focus on his candidacy full time. In August 2007, both Quax and Brown were polling \"neck and neck\". Brown\\'s {{16}} was based on several policies, including; capping rates at the cost of {{17}}, increasing public transport, and working with youth in the region. \\n\\nBrown won the election in October 2007 with more than 32,000 votes; his next closest rival Dick Quax had less than 18,000, and the election was jokingly called a \\'Lenslide\\' by some. He was officially sworn in on 26 October 2007 at the Manukau City Council hall.\\n\\nOn 31 May 2008 he suffered a {{19}} while at a music awards ceremony, and was admitted to Auckland Hospital. He had a congenital heart problem that had not been diagnosed before. Brown had successful heart bypass surgery two days later and made a full recovery, returning to his duties after a few months. His wife acknowledged that the attack was not stress-related, but rather a family issue, with Len\\'s mother having died from a heart attack at 47.\\n\\nIn August 2009, Brown stated he would run for the mayoralty of the combined {{22}} \"super-city\" in the Auckland mayoral election, 2010. Brown announced his candidacy in front of more than 300 supporters at Sorrento in the Park, One Tree Hill, Maungakiekie. His campaign speech focused on delivering public transport, public ownership of the region\\'s public assets, environmental protection, economic and social development. He won the position by 60,000 votes over main rival candidate, Auckland City mayor John Banks, on 9 October 2010.\\n\\nIn June 2010, Brown came under media attention for matters relating to his spending on his council credit card and other council expense claims, which included items of a personal nature like toys, groceries and insect repellent. His later explanations for these purchases were also examined at a council meeting, where Brown repeatedly slapped his face and got emotional. An advisor later explained that Brown\\'s emotional behaviour was caused by his use of a Maori tradition, which Brown said was not true.\\n\\nAnother council expense claim included an $810 dinner at a restaurant, but Brown refused to say who was there. He said that the event was a fundraiser for a local singer for which the Council bought a table, an explanation later supported by the artist.\\n\\nBrown is married to Shirley Anne Inglis, and has three children. They live in the Totara Park suburb of Manukau.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Louis XIV, also popularly known as the Sun King (5 September 1638–1 September 1715) was the {{0}} and {{1}} from 14 May 1643 until his death. He was a king for 72 years. This was the longest recorded rule of any European {{2}}. He is often seen as the typical example of {{3}}. He was the oldest of two brothers the other being {{4}}. The two were very close and Philippe was later created the {{5}}.\\n\\nLouis' parents were {{6}} and {{7}}. He was the unexpected child of King Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, who had not had children in their 22-year marriage. He was christened Louis Dieudonné (literally, “gift of God”). In 1643, before his fifth birthday, his father died, and Louis inherited the throne of France. Because Louis XIV was too young to rule, his mother ruled France with Cardinal Mazarin, the Italian financier who had been the principal {{9}} of Louis XIII. Mazarin had guided the nation through the later stages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). In this war France struggled against the {{11}} that ruled Spain for military supremacy in {{12}}. \\n\\nAfter Mazarin died in 1661, Louis declared that he would rule France without a chief minister, something no French king had done in living memory. He intended to rule as an absolute monarch, believing that his power as king was derived from God and that he was responsible to God alone. He was obliged to rule for the benefit of his people. While Louis assumed responsibility for decision making, he understood that he must rule within the constraints of the laws and customs of his kingdom. Louis consulted widely with his {{13}} and ministers, and he met weekly with members of his high council. He created an informal cabinet, which was eventually led by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, chief minister of finance. \\n\\nNevertheless, the system of absolute monarchy emphasized the role of the king, and no monarch was more successful in creating the image of monarchy than Louis XIV. He took the sun as his emblem and connected himself to its radiant image.\\n\\nStarting in 1661, King Louis XIV transformed a humble hunting lodge into a glittering palace.  Over 30,000 men worked on constructing the Palace of Versailles, a project that drained the royal treasury for decades. Expenses included not only building but also diverting rivers, piping in fresh water, and planting thousands of orange trees to mask the smell of sewage that could not be properly drained away. In May 1682, Louis moved the capital of France to {{16}}, 12 miles away of {{17}}. It was Louis XIV's motive to remove himself and his  nobles from the political intrigues of Paris. It became a symbol of his Absolute Monarchy.\\n\\nAlthough Louis dreamed of a Spanish inheritance for his heirs, his military policy was not to expand French territory. He fought his early wars for defensive purposes—to secure France’s northern border and to dislodge the Spanish from strategic towns.\\n\\nLouis fought the War of the Devolution (1667-1668) to assert his claims to a portion of {{18}}’s possessions after his wife’s father, {{19}}, died. Louis claimed the Spanish Netherlands in place of the wedding gift that Philip IV had never paid. \\n\\nThe French aggression in the Spanish {{20}} caused relations between France and Holland to deteriorate. The Dutch had already fought the Spanish for generations to protect against an invasion of their country. They had no intention of allowing the French to pose the same threat by occupying the territories on their border. The result was war in the Netherlands from 1672 to 1678, during which Louis again demonstrated the effectiveness of French might. In a sweeping campaign, Louis almost succeeded in conquering {{21}}. To protect themselves, the Dutch opened their dikes, flooded the countryside, and turned Amsterdam into a virtual island. Louis’s armies could not advance farther, and they began negotiating a truce. War resumed, however, when Spain and Austria allied themselves with Holland, and Louis signed a treaty with England in 1670 to keep the English navy neutral. Neither side could win a decisive victory, and both suffered from financial exhaustion, which ultimately led to a treaty to end the war. \\n\\nLouis revoked, or ended, the {{22}}. This Treaty said that there would be freedom of religion in France. This means that everybody in France could worship the way they wanted to. When Louis revoked the Treaty of Nantes, he said that all people in France must be {{23}}. Because of this, 50 thousand {{24}} workers left France and went to {{25}}, {{26}}, and {{27}}. \\n\\nWhile Louis ruled, France became the most powerful country in all of Europe, and many other countries copied the French people's way of dressing and thinking. He also encouraged people to explore Canada, and tried very hard to make France larger. Louis spent a lot of money on wars, and France went into deep debt because of him.\\n\\nBy the middle of the 1680s the Sun King was losing much of his shine. Mazarin had taught him to work rigorously, and Louis maintained a punishing schedule throughout his life, shrugging off a series of minor illnesses and not listening to the advice of his physicians. Eventually a broken {{28}} put an end to his vigorous horseback riding, and gout ended his long walks around Versailles. He was wheeled to the throne room or carried to his carriage. In 1683 his first wife died, and Louis secretly married his longtime mistress, Françoise d’Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon. In 1711 he went through the tragedy of the death of his oldest son and the following year that of his oldest grandson.\\n\\nFrench kings after Louis XIV taxed a lot of money from the poor people to try and pay off the debt. This is part of what led to the French Revolution.\\n\\nIn a world that regarded territory, power, and wealth as paramount, Louis XIV was recognized as a great king. He transformed France into the dominant nation in Europe, expanded its boundaries, and left his heirs secure in their possessions. Louis reached the height of his power in the 1670s, and he protected what he had achieved for the next four decades in the face of a Europe united against him. Moreover, he eventually realized his dream of seeing a Bourbon on the Spanish throne. During Louis’s reign, France also consolidated the administration of its colonial possessions and commerce, becoming a world power. On the domestic front, Louis strengthened the central government’s control over the diverse regions of France, incorporating his territorial gains into a united state. On the other hand, he provoked controversy when he restored Catholic religious unity by revoking the Edict of Nantes and repressing Protestantism. Unfortunately many of Louis’s policies, both domestic and foreign, caused great hardship to ordinary people, many of whom suffered starvation, fled their homeland, or lived in terror of persecution. Ultimately, Louis XIV wished to bring glory to France and to his dynasty, and he died believing that he had.\",\n",

It was made by the clock-maker Louis Dauthiau. The bronze casing was made by Jacques and Philippe II Caffiéri. The clock was used to determine the first official time system throughout the kingdom. The entire fixture measures over two meters tall.\\n\\nThe Academy of Science examined and approved the clock in August 1749. The Duc de Chaulnes presented it to Louis XV on 7 September 1750. It was put in the clock cabinet in 1754. The room actually got its name because of the large astronomical clock dials in the wainscoting. These clocks displayed the sunrises and moonrises every day. The king's scientific interests led him to upgrade that daily experience by having the Passemant clock installed in the room.\\n\\nIn 1692, the room was an Antechamber and part of Louis XIV's Art Cabinet. In 1738, it was remodeled into an oval-shaped drawing room. In 1760, it found its present form. The paneling is by Verberckt and Rousseau.  The overdoors are copies of the Diana story originally painted by Boucher. The furniture in the room includes hunting tables ordered by Louis XV from Slodtz, Foliot, and Roumier. A Sèvres bisque equestrian statue depicting Frederic II stands in the room. Another equestrian statue in the room depicts Louis XV.

These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air {{27}}s, along with the bodies of new victims. \\n\\nIn early August 1943, the Sonderkommando revolted.  Several Nazi guards were killed and about 200 prisoners escaped from the camp; almost a hundred survived the subsequent chase.  Because of this, in October 1943, the Nazis stopped killing prisoners in Treblinka's gas chambers.\\n\\nIn late July 1944, Soviet troops were getting close to Treblinka.  There were between 300 and 700 Jewish prisoners left at the camp.  The Nazi guards shot them all.  The Nazis then quickly destroyed the camp.  Before running away, they built a farmhouse for a watchman and sloughed over the ground to try to hide the evidence of their genocide.  Then they ran away from the camp.\\n\\nDuring the last week of July 1944, Soviet troops arrived at Treblinka.\",\n",

In it, Uncle Ben and Peter Parker’s Aunt May are shown as they are in the Spider-Man tales. Their first names are the same but their last names are never told. The story is about Linda Brown, May and Ben’s niece and adopted daughter who has to ride in a wheelchair. At the end of the story Linda turns out to be a mermaid (her fins were always covered by a blanket) and swims away to the ocean. This tale has not been kept in the Spider-Man’s main story line. Linda’s last name, Brown, shows that she most likely would have to be the daughter of a brother or sister other than Peter Parker\\'s parents. The story was later printed again in the comic, Marvel Tales #83 in 1977. An editor opened it saying, \"The resemblance is startling! Are these people the Parkers?

It lies at the southern edge of the {{4}} and is located between the dry {{5}} land to the north and the {{6}} areas to the south. The Sahel has a tropical semi-arid {{7}}. The temperature is high throughout the year. There is little {{8}} in the Sahel (between 100-150 mm and 600mm). It is concentrated during {{9}} months and can be unreliable. It may be very dry in some years, especially if a large area of low pressure, which brings rain, is not carried North over the Sahel by strong winds.\\n\\nThe Sahel is the Arabic word for 'edge' or 'shore'.\\n\\nThe Sahel is facing a big problem, {{11}}.\\n\\nAs the climate of Sahel was mainly dry and hot and leads to a high evaporation rate and also little rainfalls. The distribution of rainfall in the Sahel region is uneven. The rainfall in the region has been below average since 1970. The Sahel is becoming drier on the whole. The problem of drought affects most of the countries. As a result, crops and animals die. There is no vegetation to protect the soil, which is then removed by flash floods and strong wind. This leads to soil erosion. Finally the desert spreads towards the surrounding areas.\\n\\nWith better medical services, the birth rate increases and the death rate decreases in the Sahel. As a result, the population in the Sahel is growing. To meet the ever-increasing demand for firewood, a lot of trees have been cut down. More land has become barren. This is called deforestation. \\n\\nFurthermore, people farm intensively in order to grow more crops, the soil becomes infertile and lack of nutrients. If this process continues for a long time, no crops can be grown. This is called overcultivation. \\n\\nPeople keep animals for food due to the lack of good soil, the animals will have to eat grass and etc. But as the animals eat the grass, they also dug up the soil. As the people keep too much animals, the demand of grass is too much, and while the animals keep dugging the soil up as they eat, and the wind and rain will blow away the soil, which cause soil erosion, this process is called overgrazing. \\n\\nAs an solution, more mordan solutions can be used to give out a better agricultural result in Sahel. We can try drip irrigation or hybrid. We should stop using excessive water (e.g. Having long baths) and consider our actions, to save Sahel and lake Chad before it is too late.\",\n",

With this, certain states of the European Union will send {{3}} forces as well as {{4}}s to help make Kosovo more secure. This is what was agreed by the Ahtisaari plan. The idea is to continue the presence of foreign police forces to help the police in Kosovo, as planned under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. {{6}} and {{7}} see this mission as illegal. The plan is to have 2.000 police force and lawyers on the ground. The mission started to deploy its forces on 16 February 2008. Currently only 400 of the some 1,900 police officers and judges foreseen by the EULEX mission are in place.\\n\\nThe  {{8}} agreed on sending 1800 to 1900 people on 14 December 2007. Because of the unstable political climate, this force was later increased to 2000 people. Primarily this was done because it was impossible to reach an agreement with Serbia. The force is made up mainly of  police officers. Some of the officers have received training on how to control {{9}}ing crowds. Some people of the force are {{10}}s and {{11}}s. Because the force is so big, there will soon be the most EU civil servants doing their job there, rather than in {{13}}. Chief of the mission is Yves de Kermabon, who is accountable to the European Union Special Representative in Kosovo, Pieter Feith. The mission is expected to cost {{17}}165 million in its first year.\\n\\nThe final decision on the mission was planned to be taken on 28 January 2008. This was postponed due to concerns over possible negative effects on the second round of the presidential election in {{19}} on 3 February 2008 and the possible signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on that date. The officially voiced reason for the postponement is the lack of a legal basis (through a UNSC resolution or something similar) for the mission. A Joint Action was approved on 4 February 2008, meaning that only the final approval is required; it is expected to be given on 18 February 2008.\\n\\nThere are still questions on how this mission should replace the UN administration in Kosovo. Until these are answered, {{21}} will not take part in the mission. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos told a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers that Spain will not send its contingent to the EULEX mission until there has been a formal transfer of powers from the United Nations.\\n\\nApart from EU members, third parties {{23}}, {{24}}, {{25}} and the {{26}} will also take part.\\n\\nThe countries of the European Union are currently divided. Some recognise Kosovo, whilst others do not. The current Presidency of the European Council said\\nthat countries could send people to take part in the mission, even without recognising Kosovo as an independent {{27}}.\\n\\nAccording to the EU, the mission will be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. This resolution introduced international rule in Kosovo in 1999. The EU force has not yet received a new UN Security Council directive, because {{29}} opposed it. Russia blocked the transfer of the UN mission to the EU. According to Serbia, the mission implies that the EU recognises Kosovo as an independent state.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Thomas Bailey Aldrich (; November 11, 1836 – March 19, 1907) was an American {{0}} figure. He is best known for the long time he was the editor of The Atlantic, when he published works by {{2}} and for his {{3}}, such as \"The Unguarded Gates.\"\\n\\nThomas Bailey Aldrich was born in {{4}}, {{5}} on November 11, 1836. When Aldrich was a child, his father moved to {{6}}. After 10 years, Aldrich was sent back to Portsmouth to get ready for {{7}}. This time in his life is talked about in his semi-autobiographical (written about a fictional character but partly about himself) story {{8}} (1870), in  which \"Tom Bailey\" is the young hero.\\n\\nAldrich gave up on going to college after his father\\'s death in 1849. At age 16, he joined his uncle\\'s  business office in New York in 1852 and started working on the {{10}}s and {{11}}s. Aldrich  made friends with other young {{12}}s, {{13}}s and {{14}}s of New York\\'s {{15}} of the early 1860s, including Edmund Clarence Stedman, Richard Henry Stoddard, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Bayard Taylor and {{20}}. From 1856 to 1859, Aldrich worked for the Home Journal, which was edited by Nathaniel Parker Willis at that time. During the Civil War, he was the editor of the New York Illustrated News.\\n\\nIn 1865 Aldrich went back to {{23}}, where he was editor in {{24}} for ten years for Ticknor and Fields — at the time they were very well thought of — of the eclectic weekly Every Saturday. It stopped being made in 1875. From 1881 to 1890, Aldrich was editor of the important Atlantic Monthly. As editor, he made tension with his publisher Henry Houghton by not agreeing to publish commissioned articles (ones that had been paid for) by his friends, including {{29}} and Marion Crawford. When Houghton argued with Aldrich for refusing articles from his friend Daniel Coit Gilman, Aldrich threatened to quit his job and finally did so in June 1890.\\n\\nMeanwhile Aldrich carried on with his private writing, both in prose (the sort of writing found in most books) and verse (poetry, songs, etc). He had many skills. He was well known for his form in poetry. His many books of verse, mainly The Ballad of Babie Bell (1856), Pampinea, and Other Poems (1861), Cloth of Gold (1874), Flower and Thorn (1876), Friar Jerome\\'s Beautiful Book (1881), Mercedes and Later Lyrics (1883), Wyndham Towers (1889), and the collected editions of 1865, 1882, 1897 and 1900, showed him to be a poet of lyrical skill and light touch. Critics said that his work was like Robert Herrick\\'s.\\n\\nAldrich\\'s longer narrative or dramatic poems did not do as well. Important work includes \"Hesperides,\" \"When the Sultan Goes to Ispahan,\" \"Before the Rain,\" \"Nameless Pain,\" \"The Tragedy,\" \"Seadrift,\" \"Tiger Lilies,\" \"The One White Rose,\" \"Palabras Cariñosas,\" \"Destiny,\" or the eight-line poem \"Identity.\"\\n\\nBeginning with the collection of stories called Marjorie Daw and Other People (1873), Aldrich wrote works of realism and quiet humour. His books Prudence Palfrey (1874), The Queen of Sheba (1877), and The Stillwater Tragedy (1880) had more dramatic action. The first showed Portsmouth with the loving touch shown in the shorter funny tale, A Rivermouth Romance (1877). In An Old Town by the Sea (1893), Aldrich wrote about his place of birth again. Travel and description are the theme of From Ponkapog to Pesth (1883).\\n\\nAldrich married and had two sons. {{34}} is said to hated Aldrich\\'s wife Lilian. He wrote in 1893: \"Lord, I loathe that woman so! She is an idiot—an absolute idiot—and does not know it ... and her husband, the sincerest man that walks ... tied for life to this vacant hellion, this clothes-rack, this twaddling, blethering, driveling blatherskite!\"\\n\\nThe Aldrich family were close friends of Henry L. Pierce, former mayor of Boston and chocolate magnate (he made a lot of money from the chocolate business). When Pierce died death in 1896, he willed the Aldriches his home in Canton, Massachusetts.\\n\\nIn 1901, Aldrich\\'s son Charles, who had gotten married the year before, was found to have a disease called {{36}}. Aldrich built two houses, one for his son and one for him and his family, in Saranac Lake, New York, which was the leading treatment centre for the disease at the time. On March 6, 1904, Charles Aldrich died of tuberculosis, at the age of thirty-four. The family left Saranac Lake and never went back.\\n\\nAldrich died in Boston on March 19, 1907. His last words were, \"In spite of it all, I am going to sleep; put out the lights.\" His Life was written by Ferris Greenslet (1908).',\n",

Once every room has been assigned to a guest, any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet cannot be served - in other words, the hotel is fully booked.\\n\\nNow suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms. As a convenience, the rooms have numbers, the first room has the number 1, the second has number 2, and so on. If all the rooms are filled, it might appear that no more guests can be taken in, as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms. This is wrong, though. A room can be provided for another guest. This can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. In the general case, the guest in room n will be moved to room n+1. After all guests have moved, room 1 is empty, and the new guest now has a room to occupy. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.\\n\\nAnother thing that can be done with this imaginary hotel is to double the number of people inside, again when all the rooms are already full. This is done by asking each guest to {{8}} their room number by two and move to that room. (If their previous room number was n, this time they would move to room number 2n.) This would send the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 4, the guest in room 3 to room 6, the guest in room 4 to room 8, and so on. After finishing, we find that all the rooms with the {{9}}s are empty. Then we can put an infinite number of guests into these empty rooms. Now the number of guests in the hotel has been doubled without making the hotel bigger.\\n\\nThe guest at room 11 would move to room 101.\\nThe second person of group 5 (Address 5-2) would go to room 25.\\n\\nThis is not really a {{10}}, it is only counterintuitive. In a normal hotel, with a finite number of rooms, the number of odd-numbered rooms, is smaller than the total number of rooms. In Hilbert\\'s Hotel this does not seem to be the case. \\n\\nThe guest 1 of group 2 of vehicle 1 (1-2-1) goes to room 121.\\n\\nAddress 4-7-7-4 goes to room 4774.\\n\\nAddress 0-1 (hotel dweller) stays because 1-0-0-0-1 moves to room 10,001.\\n\\nand so on.\\n\\nEach pod holds 10 people.\\n\\nEach megapod holds 10 pods. (100 people)\\n\\nEach supermegapod holds 10 megapods. (1,000 people)\\n\\nEach superdupermegapod holds 10 supermegapods.\\n\\nEach ultrasuperdupermegapod holds 10 superdupermegapod.\\n\\nEach ultrasuperduperubermegapod holds 10 ultrasuperdupermegapods. (1,000,000 people)\\n\\nAnd so on.\\nThis assumes that there is never an infinitieth layer. (The main ship)\\n\\nHilbert\\'s paradox is a {{11}}: it leads to a counter-intuitive result that is provably true. The statements \"there is a guest to every room\" and \"no more guests can be accommodated\" are not equivalent when there are infinitely many rooms. An analogous situation is presented in Cantor\\'s diagonal proof.\\n\\nAt first, this state of affairs might seem to be counter-intuitive. The properties of \"infinite collections of things\" are quite different from those of \"finite collections of things\". The paradox of Hilbert\\'s Grand Hotel can be understood by using Cantor\\'s theory of transfinite numbers. In an ordinary (finite) hotel with more than one room, the number of odd-numbered rooms is obviously smaller than the total number of rooms. However, in Hilbert\\'s aptly named Grand Hotel, the quantity of odd-numbered rooms is not smaller than the total \"number\" of rooms. In mathematical terms, the {{15}} of the {{16}} containing the odd-numbered rooms is the same as the cardinality of the {{17}} of all rooms. Indeed, infinite sets are characterized as sets that have proper subsets of the same cardinality. For countable sets (sets with the same cardinality as the {{18}}s) this cardinality is <math>\\\\aleph_0</math>.\\n\\nPut differently, for any countably infinite set, there exists a bijective function which maps the countably infinite set to the set of natural numbers, even if the countably infinite set contains the natural numbers. For example, the set of rational numbers—those numbers which can be written as a quotient of integers—contains the natural numbers as a subset, but is no bigger than the set of natural numbers since the rationals are countable: there is a bijection from the naturals to the rationals.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A government is a group of people that have the {{0}} to rule in a {{1}}, according to the {{2}}. This territory may be a {{3}}, a {{4}} or {{5}} within a country, or a region. \\n \\n\\nThe most common type of government in the Western world is called {{6}}. In democracies, people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer. The people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on {{7}}s such as the {{8}} or {{9}}. Political parties are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people. \\n\\nHowever, many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters. One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament, or limit the parties access to mass media such as television. Another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power. Few countries are textbook democracies, and the differences between them has been much studied.\\n\\nA monarchy is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family, which is often called the \"royal family.\" There are two types of monarchies: absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies. In an absolute monarchy, the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers. In a constitutional monarchy a ruler\\'s powers are limited by a document called a {{13}}.\\n\\nAn {{14}} is a government by the \"best\" people. A person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat. Aristocracy is different from nobility, in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule, an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule, or that rulers be chosen in a different manner.\\n\\nUnder a {{15}}, the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country. Originally, the {{16}} made dictators to lead during time of war. The Roman dictators (and Greek {{17}}s) were not always bad. The Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, a dictator\\'s rule is not stopped by any laws, constitutions, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by dictators. Examples of dictators include {{18}}, Adolf Hitler, Augusto Pinochet,  {{20}}, {{21}}, and {{22}}.\\n\\nAn {{23}} is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people. These people may spread power equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler, but several powerful people. Some past examples of oligarchy are the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and {{25}} {{26}}. A fictional example is the {{27}}n society of Oceania in the book {{28}}. Some critics of {{29}} think of the {{30}} as an oligarchy. This view is shared by {{31}}.\\n\\nThe simplest idea of government is those who {{32}} over people and {{33}}. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a {{34}} or as big as a {{35}} (like {{36}} and India). \\n\\nThose people who rule the land can allow others to {{38}} it. It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that {{39}}s describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called {{40}}. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in {{41}}, without government. This view is called {{42}}. \\n\\nAlmost every place on {{43}} is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small {{44}}d areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims \\'sovereign control\\' over it. The word \"sovereign\" is old and means \"control by a {{45}}\" ({{46}}). Governments of {{47}}s, {{48}}, {{49}} and other {{50}} are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the {{51}}.\\n\\nIt is from Kings and {{52}} that modern governments and {{53}}s came. The {{54}} of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his {{55}}s. From this we get the modern idea of {{56}} in {{57}}. A government is said to regulate {{58}} as well as to rule over land.\\n\\nGovernments also control people and decide things about what {{59}} to accept or {{60}}. In very many countries, there are strict rules about {{61}} and {{62}}s that are part of {{63}} and offenders are punished for disobeying them.\\n\\n{{64}} is how government is paid for in most countries. People who {{65}}, {{66}}, {{67}}, {{68}}, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the {{69}} to a government.\\n\\nThere are many theories of how to organize government better. These are called theories of {{70}}. Because government is run by people who can be greedy, many people think {{71}}s must be {{72}}ed by some kind of {{73}}. That way, if government does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next {{74}}. Still many countries\\' governments are not a {{75}} but other forms in which only a few people have power.\\n\\nThere are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of {{76}}. No matter how a government is chosen, it must do politics to keep {{77}}.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Blowback is a system of operation for self-loading firearms that obtains energy from the motion of the cartridge case as it is pushed to the rear by expanding gases created by the ignition of the propellant charge.\\n\\nSeveral blowback systems exist within this broad principle of operation, each distinguished by the methods used to control bolt movement. In most actions that use blowback operation, the breech is not locked mechanically at the time of firing: the inertia of the bolt and recoil spring(s), relative to the weight of the bullet, delays opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel. A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.\\n\\nOther operating principles for self-loading firearms include blow forward, gas operation, recoil operation, revolver, Gatling, and chain. The blowback principle may be considered a simplified form of gas operation, since the cartridge case behaves like a piston driven by the powder gases.\\n\\nSimple blowback operation is where the recoil of the cartridge moves the bolt rearwards to reload the next round. This operation is found in automatic pistols and submachine guns and firearms chambered in lower pressure rounds. The likes of rifle rounds which have higher pressures is usually deemed unsuitable for simple blowback operation. However there is Delayed Blowback where the chamber is locked until the pressures drop to a safe level to reload.\\n\\nDelayed blowback is similar to simple blowback but is capable of handling the pressures of rifle rounds. It uses an operation that delays the opening of the bolt when firing.\\n\\nLever delayed blowback is where the bolt has a lever that slows the opening of the bolt but accelerates the bolt carrier, the bolt then also accelerates with the bolt carrier. The AA52 machine gun and the FAMAS use this operation.\\n\\nRoller delayed blowback is where the bolt has two rollers that pop out both sides of the bolt to lock the chamber. The Sturmgewehr 45 assault rifle, Heckler & Koch MP5 and Calico submachine gun uses this operation.\\n\\nPrimer actuated blowback is when the round is fired, the primer moves the firing pin rearwards to unlock the bolt. The Garand Model 1919 and Postnikov APT uses this operation.',\n",

This season features sixteen HouseGuests. \\n\\nThe show\\'s format remained the same from previous seasons of the show. A group of contestants, known as \"HouseGuests\", compete to win the series by voting each other off. They must be the last HouseGuest remaining. Each week, one HouseGuest, known as the Head of Household, must nominate two of their HouseGuests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto can remove one of the nominees from the block. The Head of Household must nominate another HouseGuest as a replacement. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of them, the nominee with the most votes are removed from the show. When only two HouseGuests remain, the last seven evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury of Seven, would decide which of them would win the $500,000 prize. A HouseGuest can be expelled from the show for not following rules.\\n\\nThere have been several controversial remarks from some of the Big Brother 15 HouseGuests. Their comments have angered viewers and because of this, the show\\'s ratings have dropped. Many {{4}} have made negative reviews about the HouseGuests who made these remarks. HouseGuest including Aaryn Gries, GinaMarie Zimmerman and Spencer Clawson have made {{5}} comments about two African American contestants on the show. Spencer made negative comments about a {{7}} contestant calling him \"{{8}} the Fag\". Aaryn and GinaMarie also made negative comments about {{9}} contestant Helen. Aaryn and GinaMarie were fired from their jobs because of their comments.

       "  'text': 'Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Cenker (born November 5, 1948) is an American {{0}}, and former {{1}}. In January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the seventh flight of {{2}}. Cenker was a type of astronaut called a Payload Specialist.\\n\\nThis mission was the final flight before the Challenger explosion, which ended the Space Shuttle program until 1988. As a result, Cenker\\'s mission was called \"The End of Innocence\" for the Shuttle.\\n\\nFollowing the end of his space mission, Cenker returned to work as an engineer, and also makes appearances for NASA.\\n\\nCenker was born on November 5, 1948, and raised near Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He started his education at St. Fidelis College Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania, leaving in 1962. He later attended Uniontown Joint Senior High School and graduated in 1966.\\n\\nCenker enrolled at {{4}} in 1970 where he earned a {{5}} degree in {{6}}. He continued his studies at Penn State and earned a {{7}} degree in 1973, also in aerospace engineering. Cenker earned a second Master of Science degree in {{8}} from {{9}} in 1977.\\n\\nCenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor company GE Astro Space. Cenker worked on hardware design and systems design concerning {{10}} attitude control. He also worked on {{11}} operations, as well as spacecraft assembly, test, and pre-launch operations. He spent two years on the {{12}} {{13}} program, but spent most of his career working on commercial {{14}}.\\n\\nCenker\\'s positions included integration and test manager for the Satcom D and E spacecraft, where he was responsible for all launch site activities. He also served as spacecraft bus manager on the Spacenet/GStar programs. He was responsible for ensuring the spacecraft bus could interface with multiple rockets, including the Delta, Space Shuttle, and Ariane launch vehicles.\\n\\nAs an incentive for a spacecraft owner to contract with NASA to use a Shuttle launch instead of an unmanned, commercial launch system, {{16}} permitted contracting companies to apply for a Payload Specialist seat on the same mission. When RCA contracted with NASA to launch Satcom Ku-1, RCA Astro-Electronics\\' manager of systems engineering for the Satcom-K program Bob Cenker, and his co-worker Gerard Magilton, were selected to train as Payload Specialists.\\n\\nCenker and Magilton trained with career astronauts as well as other Payload and Mission Specialists, including those scheduled for the next scheduled flight, that of the {{17}} mission, STS-51-L.\\n\\nThis flight of {{18}} was originally scheduled to occur in August 1985, but the timeline slipped. In July 1985 the payload was finalized to include the RCA satellite, and Cenker was assigned to the mission, now designated as STS-61-C. Magilton was assigned as the back-up.Prior to its successful launch, Columbia had several aborted launch attempts, including one on January 6 which was \"one of the most hazardous in the shuttle’s operational history\" to that point, as well as a near-catastrophic abort three days later. Referring to the January 9 abort, pilot Charlie Bolden later stated that it “...would have been catastrophic, because the engine would have exploded had we launched.” \\n\\nColumbia ultimately launched and achieved orbit on January 12, 1986, with a full crew of seven. Along with Cenker, the crew included Robert L. \"Hoot\" Gibson, future NASA Administrator {{19}}, George D. Nelson, Steven A. Hawley, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, and {{20}} {{21}}.\\n  Cenker and his crewmates traveled over 2.1 million miles in 96 orbits aboard Columbia and logged over 146 hours in {{22}}.\\n\\nDuring the six-day mission, January 12–18, Cenker performed a variety of physiological tests, operated a primary experiment – an infrared imaging camera – and assisted with the deployment of RCA Americom\\'s Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective. Satcom K-1 was deployed nearly 10 hours into the mission, and Satcom later reached its geostationary “slot” at 85 degrees West longitude where it remained operational until April 1997, the last major commercial satellite deployed by the space shuttle program.\\n\\nIn a 2014 video of the \"Tell Me a Story\" series titled \"Close My Eyes & Drift Away\", posted to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex YouTube channel, Cenker tells a humorous story regarding a zero-g sleeping problem that he faced on his mission.\\n\\nThe next Shuttle launch, ten days after the return of Columbia, resulted in the destruction of Challenger with the loss of all aboard, including Cenker\\'s counterpart from Hughes Aircraft, civilian crew member and Payload Specialist Greg Jarvis. Accordingly, commander Gibson later called the STS-61-C mission \"The End of Innocence\" for the Shuttle Program.\\n\\nFollowing the Challenger disaster, the shuttle fleet was grounded until 1988. Even after Shuttle missions resumed, civilian Payload Specialists like Cenker were excluded until the Payload Specialist program was reinstated on December 2, 1990 when Samuel T. Durrance, an Applied Physics Laboratory astrophysicist and Ronald A. Parise, a Computer Sciences Corporation astronomer, flew aboard STS-35. By that time, RCA had been purchased by {{24}}, and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE. Following two additional ownership transitions, the facility was closed in 1998. As as a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space.\\n\\nNASA\\'s Payload Specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as Cenker and Greg Jarvis (killed aboard Challenger), politicians such as Bill Nelson, and others civilians such as Teacher in Space {{25}} (also killed aboard Challenger). Even the flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator {{26}} was questioned. The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission.\\n\\nFollowing the completion of his shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the civilian aerospace field. Cenker\\'s last two years with RCA Astro-Electronics and it\\'s successor GE Astro Space were spent as Manager of Payload Accommodations on an EOS spacecraft program. After leaving GE, Cenker served as a consultant for various aerospace companies regarding micro-gravity research, and spacecraft design, assembly and flight operations. Cenker supported {{27}} and systems architecture studies for various spacecraft projects, including smallsats, military {{28}}, and large, assembled-in-orbit platforms. His contributions included launch vehicle evaluation and systems engineering support for {{29}} on {{30}}, and launch readiness for the Globalstar constellation. Other efforts include systems engineering and operations support for INTELSAT on Intelsat K and Intelsat VIII, for {{31}} on Telstar 401 and 402, for Fairchild-Matra  on SPAS III, for Martin Marietta on Astra 1B, BS-3N, ACTS, and for the {{32}} Series 7000 communications satellites.\\n\\nCenker continues to make periodic public appearances representing NASA and the shuttle astronaut program, including one at the {{33}} in March 2017.\\n\\nIn 2017, Cenker\\'s STS-61C crewmate former US Senator {{35}} spoke at a session of the {{36}}. In an address, titled \"Mission to Mars and Space Shuttle Flight 30th Anniversary\", he read into the {{37}} the details of the mission of STS-61C, as well as the names and function of each crew member including Cenker.\\n\\nBob Cenker is married to Barbara Ann Cenker; they have two sons and a daughter.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Macbeth is an opera by {{0}}.  It is based on {{1}}’s play with the same name.  The opera is normally in Italian, though there is also a French version that\\'s almost never used anymore.  The  {{5}} (the words) was written by {{6}} with some extra additions by Andrea Maffei.\\n\\nVerdi wrote several works based on Shakespeare plays.  Macbeth was the first of these.  It was composed in  911at a time when he was composing a lot of operas.  In those days Italian operas were always about a love story, but Macbeth was unusual because there was no love story.  Instead, it is a story about wanting power, even if means murder.  The opera helped to make him very famous, and it has remained one of his most popular operas.  \\n  \\n\\nAndrea Maffei, a poet and friend of Verdi, suggested to him that Macbeth would be a good story to make into an opera.  Verdi did not read Shakespeare’s original work until after he had composed the opera.  The words were written for him by Piave who based the libretto on an Italian translation.  Verdi loved the story, he thought it was “one of the greatest creations of man”.  The opera is very similar to the story told by Shakespeare, but Verdi uses a large chorus of witches instead of just three.  The last act ends with the refugees coming together on the English border, and, in the revised version, ends with a chorus of bards celebrating their victory over the cruel {{7}}.\\n\\nThe 1847 version was performed a great deal all over Italy.  Then, in 1865, Verdi made several changes to the opera in a revised version.  It was to be performed in {{8}}, and in France people expected to have {{9}} music in operas.  Verdi wrote some music for the dancers, and took the opportunity to make other changes as well. Verdi worked in Italian, and had it translated into French for the performance there, but people don\\'t use the French translation. They instead use all his changes for the French version, but keep the Italian text.\\n\\nAfter 1865 it was not performed very often.  Verdi was very disappointed about this because he was particularly proud of this opera.  He had worked closely with Piave.  It was Verdi who gave Piave the outline of the story he wanted him to write.  Verdi concentrated on three main characters: Lady Macbeth, Macbeth and the Witches.  It was not until around the time of {{10}} that it became very popular again.\\n\\nScene 1: A heath\\n\\nIn the {{11}} (the music of the opening) we hear music that comes later in the sleep-walking scene.  The chorus of {{12}}es {{13}} the future.  A messenger arrives to say that Macbeth has been given the title and estates of Cawdor.  Macbeth and Banquo, his {{14}}, think about the witches’ prophecy.  Half of the prophecy has just come true (the other half being that Macbeth will become king, and that the kings that come after him will be Banquo’s {{15}}s).  The witches dance and sing at the end of this scene.\\n\\nScene 2: Macbeth\\'s castle\\n\\nLady Macbeth reads a letter from her husband in which he tells her about the prophecy the witches had made.  She decides to make sure that Macbeth really does become king.  She decides that she must persuade her husband to murder Duncano (Duncan, King of Scotland).  Macbeth sees a {{16}} in front of him.  He takes it and murders Duncano (who never sings in the opera).  Then he is horrified at what he has done.  His wife is disgusted that her husband feels terrible about the murder.  She takes the dagger and completes the crime, then smears Duncano’s blood on the guards who are asleep.  Banquo and Macduff, a Scottish {{17}}, arrive, Macduff discovers the crime, and all the characters sing a chorus asking God to punish the murderer(s).  \\n\\nScene 1: A room in the castle\\n\\nMacbeth is now king.  He is worried about the prophecy that Banco’s heirs will become king.  He and his wife decide that Banco and his son must be murdered.\\n \\nScene 2: Outside the castle \\n\\nA gang of murderers are waiting for Banco.  He is caught, but his son Fleanzio manages to escape. \\n\\nScene 3: A dining hall in the castle\\n\\nMacbeth receives the guests and Lady Macbeth sings a brindisi (drinking song) which is quite similar to the famous one in {{18}}.  Macbeth is told that Banco has been murdered, but when he goes back to the table he finds Banco’s {{19}} sitting in his place.  He shouts and raves at the ghost.  The other people cannot see the ghost and think that Macbeth has gone mad.  The feast ends quickly.\\n\\nThe witches\\' cave\\n\\nThe witches are sitting round a cauldron in a dark cave. They sing, and then dance a ballet which was written for the 1865 version.  The music sounds like {{20}}.  Macbeth enters and wants the witches to tell him his future.  They conjure up three apparitions for him. The first one tells him to beware of Macduff. The second tells him that he cannot be harmed by a man \\'born of woman\\'. The third one says that he cannot be conquered till Birnam Wood marches against him. \\n\\nMacbeth is then shown the ghost of Banco and his {{22}}s, eight future Kings of Scotland.  This shows that the witches prophecy from the beginning of the opera must indeed come true.  Macbeth collapses.  When he recovers and tells his wife what he saw, she is even more determined to kill Banco’s son and all his family.\\n \\n\\nScene 1: Near the border between England and Scotland\\n\\nScottish refugees stand near the English border and sing a song about how Macbeth, the {{23}}, is oppressing his people.\\n \\nMalcolm, Banco’s son, tells his soldiers to cut  branches from  trees in Birnam Wood and carry them as they attack Macbeth\\'s army. They want to free Scotland from tyranny.\\n\\n Scene 2: Macbeth\\'s castle \\n\\nA doctor and a servant watch the Queen as she walks in her sleep, wringing her hands trying to clean them of blood. \\n\\nScene 3: The battlefield\\n\\nMacbeth has heard that an army is coming towards him.  He is told that the Queen is dead, but he does not seem to mind.  He gets his army together.  Banco’s army march against him with their tree branches.  The prophecy has come true: Birnam Wood has marched up against him.  Macduff fights Macbeth and kills him.  He tells Macbeth that he was not \"born of woman\" but \"ripped\" from his mother\\'s womb.  The fight continues.  Macduff kills Macbeth.  Macduff\\'s men call out that Macduff is the new King.  All the soldiers and the women sing a {{24}} to victory.',\n",

In the end, his {{5}} makes him admit the crime. {{6}} starred in a {{7}} {{8}} based on the story.\\n\\nOn the eve of his death, an unnamed narrator opens the story by proclaiming that he is sane, despite the wild narrative he is about to convey. This narrative begins years before, when the narrator’s honorable character is well known and celebrated. He confesses a great love for cats and dogs, both of which, he says, respect the fidelity of friendship, unlike fellow men. The narrator marries at a young age and introduces his wife to the domestic joys of owning pets. Among birds, goldfish, a dog, rabbits, and a monkey, the narrator singles out a large and beautiful black cat, named Pluto, as his favorite.\\n\\nThough he loves Pluto, the narrator begins to suffer from violent mood swings, predominantly due to the influence of alcohol. He takes to mistreating not only the other animals but also his wife. During this uncontrollable rage, he spares only Pluto. After returning home quite drunk one night, the narrator lashes out at Pluto. Believing the cat has avoided him, he vengefully grasps the cat, only to be bitten on the hand. In demonic retaliation, the narrator pulls a penknife from his pocket and cuts out one of the cat’s eyes. Though the narrator wakes the next morning with a partial feeling of remorse, he is unable to reverse the newly ominous course of his black soul. Ignored for certain now by the wounded cat, the narrator soon seeks further retaliation. He is overwhelmed by a spirit of PERVERSENESS, and sets out to commit wrong for the sake of wrong. He hangs Pluto from the limb of a tree one morning.\\nOn the night of Pluto’s hanging, the narrator’s family’s house burns down, but he dismisses the possibility of a connection between the two events. The day after the fire, which destroys all the narrator’s possessions, he witnesses a group of neighbors collected around a wall that remains standing. Investigating their shouts of amazement, the narrator discovers the impression of a gigantic cat—with a rope around its neck—on the surface of the wall. The narrator attempts to explain rationally the existence of the impression, but he finds himself haunted by this phantasm over the course of many months. One night, while out drunk, the narrator discovers a black object poised upon a large barrel of alcohol. A new black cat has appeared, resembling Pluto but with a splash of white on his fur.\\n\\nAs with Pluto, the narrator experiences a great fondness for the mysterious cat, which no one has seen before. The cat becomes part of the household, much adored by his wife as well. However, following the earlier pattern, the narrator soon cannot resist feelings of hatred for the cat. These murderous sentiments intensify when the narrator discovers that the cat’s splash of white fur has mysteriously taken on the shape of the gallows, the structure on which a hanging takes place. The white fur reveals the mode of execution that claimed Pluto, and the narrator pledges revenge.\\nOne day, descending into the cellar of the building with his wife, the narrator almost trips over the cat. Enraged, the narrator grabs an axe to attack the cat, but his wife defends the animal. Further angered by this interference, the narrator turns his rage at his wife and buries the axe in her head. Faced with the evidence of his crime, the narrator considers many options for the body’s disposal, including dismemberment and burial. The narrator eventually decides to take advantage of the damp walls in the basement and entomb the body behind their plaster. Without any difficulty, the narrator creates a tomb in n the plaster wall, thereby hiding the body and all traces of his murder. When he finally turns to the cat, it is missing, and he concludes that it has been frightened away by his anger.\\nOn the fourth day after the murder, the police arrive unexpectedly at the narrator’s apartment. Cool and collected, the narrator leads them through the premises, even into the basement. Though facing the scene of the crime, the police do not demonstrate any curiosity and prepare to leave the residence. The narrator, however, keeps trying to allay their suspicion. Commenting upon the solid craftsmanship of the house, he taps on the wall—behind which is his wife’s body—with a cane. In response to the tapping, a long, loud cry emanates from behind the wall. The police storm the wall and dismantle it, discovering the hidden corpse. Upon its head sits the missing cat.\\n\\n\\'\\n\\nMuch like “The Tell-Tale Heart,” “The Black Cat” follows the narrator’s descent into madness after he proclaims his sanity in the tale’s opening paragraph. Even the narrator acknowledges the “wild” nature of the tale, attempting thereby to separate his mental condition from the events of the plot. The nature of the narrator’s madness differs from that of the narrator of “The Tell-Tale Heart.” “The Black Cat” does not concern itself only with the self-contained nature of the narrator’s mind. Rather, the narrator confesses an alcoholism that interferes with his grasp on reality and produces mood swings. Alcohol is, like the cat, an external agent that intrudes on the dynamics of the plot. The introduction of alcohol as a plot device is also significant because Edgar Allan Poe was an reputedly uncontrollable drunk throughout his lifetime. For many years, his biographers asserted that he died of alcohol poisoning in a gutter in Baltimore. More recent biographies insist that the exact cause of Poe’s death cannot be determined. Regardless, it is certain that Poe suffered from the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption throughout his life.\\nThe influential literary critic Tzvetan Todorov introduced a concept of the “fantastic” in the early 1970s to discuss literature of horror, and the idea can be applied usefully to “The Black Cat.” The fantastic, he asserts, explores the indefinite boundary between the real and the supernatural. The fantastic is a literary category that contains elements of both the rational and the irrational. One of the fantastic elements in “The Black Cat” is the existence of the second cat—with the changing shape of its white fur and its appearance on the corpse behind the wall. These plot twists challenge reality, but they do not completely substitute a supernatural explanation for a logical one. It is possible that the plot twists derive only from the insanity of the narrator. As a result, the plot twists, like the fantastic, hover between the real and the supernatural. The resolution of the story is both rationally possible and tremendously unlikely; the cat could inhabit the basement walls, but it is difficult to believe that it would remain silently in the wall for a long time or go unnoticed by the overly meticulous narrator.',\n",

Lake Anna is 72 miles (116 km) {{5}} of {{6}} in Louisa and Spotsylvania counties. The lake is easy to get to from {{9}} and {{10}}. Lake Anna is one of the most popular {{11}}al lakes in the state.\\n\\nIn 1829 {{12}} was discovered in Louisa county. In the 1880s gold mining reached its peak. The Goodman gold mine is the site that later became Lake Anna. The {{13}} is formed by the North Anna {{14}} on the North Anna River at . In 1968, Virginia Electric and Power Company (now Dominion) purchased 18,000 acres (73 km²) of farmlands in three counties along the North Anna and Pamunkey Rivers. They planned to provide clean, fresh water to cool the {{18}} at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station next to the lake. By 1972 the lake bottom was cleared of all {{20}} and the dam was almost finished. It was thought it would take three years to completely fill the lake. But with the additional rainfall from {{21}}, the lake was full in only 18 months. The first {{22}} were started at about that same time. Now there are about 120 different communities on the {{23}}s of the lake. In March 1986, {{24}} on the dam\\'s 1 {{25}} {{26}} {{27}} began. The two {{28}}s went into {{29}} in December 1987.\\n\\nLake Anna is about  long from tip to tip. It has some 200 miles (300 km) of shoreline. The lake is divided into two sides: the public side (also known as the \"cold\" side) and the {{30}} side (also known as the \"hot\" side). The public side is roughly 9,000 acres (36 km²), while the private side is roughly 4,000 acres (16 km²). The private side is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by {{31}} {{32}}s. The public and private sides are divided by three stone {{33}}. The private side has no marinas or public access ramps. Only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the private side. The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees much higher {{38}} traffic than the private side, especially on {{39}} {{40}}s.\\n\\nThe public side is called the \"cold\" side because it provides water to cool the generators at the power plant. The private or \"hot\" side receives warm water {{41}} from the power plant. The private side can be much warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point. There it can be too hot for swimming. The private side has an extended {{42}} season. Some water circulates back out of the private side into the public side through underground channels. As a result the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some {{43}} move to these warmer waters.\\n\\nPlans for an addition of a third {{44}} have raised {{45}}s from {{46}}s and property owners. They  fear it will increase in the water {{47}} and lower the water level, particularly on the private side. According to Dominion, the water discharged from the plant is usually about 14 degrees {{48}} warmer than the intake water.\\n\\n \\nThe dam creating the lake, North Anna Dam, is a  long and  high earthen embankment dam. It is  wide at its top which sits at an {{50}} of  above {{51}}. The dam\\'s {{52}} is located in the center of its body. Normal elevation for the reservoir is . The dam\\'s {{53}} power plant is located on the west side of the spillway. It is supplied with water via a  diameter penstock. It has a combined installed capacity of 1 {{55}}.\\n\\nLake Anna is one of the finest {{56}} fishing lakes in Virginia. Besides largemouth, there are striped bass, {{58}}, channel catfish, {{60}} and several species of {{61}}. Because of the warm water and low {{62}} the striped bass have to be stocked in Lake Anna. The walleye population has a similar problem and must also be stocked. Lake Anna has very good numbers of channel catfish, with many averaging 3 pounds. Because of the warm waters, Lake Anna can be fished all year long. It is a very popular recreational lake that offers {{64}}ing, Water skiing and Jet Skiing. As a result, Lake Anna gets very crowded.

Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.\\n\\nAn example of a logarithm is . In this logarithm, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.\\n\\nThe most common types of logarithms are common logarithms, where the base is 10, and natural logarithms, where the base is {{3}} ≈ 2.71828.\\n\\nLogarithms were first used in India in the 2nd century BC. The first to use logarithms in modern times was the German mathematician Michael Stifel (around 1487-1567). In 1544, he wrote down the following {{6}}s:  and  This is the basis for understanding logarithms. For Stifel,  and  had to be {{7}}s. John Napier (1550–1617) did not want this restriction, and wanted a range for the exponents.\\n\\nAccording to Napier, logarithms express ratios:   has the same ratio to  , as   to   if the difference of their logarithms matches. Mathematically: . At first, base {{9}} was used (even though the number had not been named yet). Henry Briggs proposed to use 10 as a base for logarithms, such logarithms are very useful in {{11}}.\\n\\nA logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of {{12}}.\\n\\nJust as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts.

Also, multiplication has one inverse operation: the division. Therefore, it may be hard to understand why exponentiation has actually two inverse operations: Why do we need the logarithm if there already is the {{13}}? This is the case because the exponentiation is not commutative.\\n\\nThe following example illustrates this:\\n\\nLogarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easier because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.\\n\\nBefore calculators became popular and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a {{15}}, a tool with logarithms written on it.\\n\\nLogarithms to base 10 are called common logarithms. They are usually written without the base. For example:\\nThis means:\\n\\nLogarithms to base e are called natural logarithms. The number {{16}} is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician {{17}}.\\n\\nThe natural logarithms can take the symbols  or \\n\\nSome authors prefer the use of natural logarithms as  but usually mention this on preface pages.\\n\\nLogarithms have many properties.

The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until the main Dutch forces {{8}} on the 14th. Dutch {{9}} in the {{10}} of {{11}} continued to fight the until 17 May, when {{12}}.\\n\\nThe Battle of the Netherlands was one of the first major uses of {{13}} to land near important targets before ground troops reached the area. The German {{14}} used paratroopers to capture several major {{15}} in the Netherlands.\\n\\nThe battle ended soon after the terrible bombing of Rotterdam by the German Luftwaffe. The Germans threatened to {{17}} other large Dutch cities if Dutch forces refused to surrender. The Dutch surrendered to prevent other cities from being destroyed. The Netherlands was {{18}} by Germany until 1945, when Dutch territory was freed.\\n\\n{{19}} and France declared war on Germany in 1939, after Germany invaded Poland. No major land attacks happened in {{21}} during the winter of 1939–1940. During this time, the British and French built up their forces to get ready for a long war, and the Germans occupied {{22}}.\\n\\nOn 9 October, Adolf Hitler ordered plans for an invasion of the Low Countries. He wanted to use them as a base to attack Great Britain. He also wanted to prevent an attack by the Allied forces, which could threaten the Ruhr Area.\\n\\nThe Dutch were not ready to stop an invasion. When Hitler came to power, the Dutch had begun to re-arm, but more slowly than France or Belgium. Only in 1936 did the Dutch {{26}} start to increase their defense {{27}}.\\n\\nDutch governments did not see Germany as a military threat. Partly this was because they did not want to cause problems with an important {{28}} partner. The Dutch did not criticize Nazi policies. The Dutch made strict budget limits to fight the {{30}}, which was hard on Dutch society.\\n\\nHendrikus Colijn, the Dutch Prime Minister between 1933 and 1939, did not think Germany would go against Dutch neutrality and invade the Netherlands. Senior officers did not try to encourage improving military defence.\\n\\nInternational stress grew in the late 1930s. Countries got concerned by the German occupation of the Rhineland in 1936; the Anschluss and Sudeten crisis of 1938; the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia in 1939; and the Italian invasion of Albania in the spring of 1939.\\n\\nThese events made the Dutch government be more careful, but they limited their reaction as much as they could. Their most important reaction was to get 100,000 men ready to fight in April 1939.\\n\\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the start of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral. The Netherlands had been neutral during the {{38}} 25 years earlier.\\n\\nThe Dutch army was ready by 24 August and set up in {{39}}. Large amounts of money (almost 900 million {{40}}s) were spent on defence. It was very difficult to obtain new weapons in wartime. The Dutch had ordered some equipment from Germany, which delayed deliveries.\\n\\nA lot of the defence funds were used for the {{41}} (now {{42}}). A lot of the money was spent on a plan to build three battle cruisers.\\n\\nThe Low Countries\\' position between France and Germany made the area a good route for either side to attack the other. In a 20 January 1940 radio speech, {{45}} tried to get the Dutch to join with the British. Both the Belgians and the Dutch refused, even though Belgium had learned about Germany\\'s plans to attack.\\n\\nThe Allies planned to attack Germany in the summer of 1941.  The French thought about going against the neutrality of the Low Countries and attacking them if they had not joined the Allies before then. If Germany attacked the Netherlands, the Allies would have to go through Belgium. The Allies also worried that the Netherlands might allow a German army into Belgium through the southern part of their lands.\\n\\nThe Dutch government never decided what to do. Most of the {{46}} wanted to resist an attack. A minority refused to become a German {{47}}. The Dutch tried to organize a peace settlement between the Allies and Germany.\\n\\nAfter the German invasion of Norway and Denmark, followed by a warning by {{49}} that a German attack on the Netherlands was going to happen, the Dutch military knew they would have to fight. They started to prepare for war. Dutch border troops were put on alert.\\n\\nReports of a Fifth Column (enemy agents acting in a country) in {{51}} caused fears that the Netherlands also had German agents and traitors. The Dutch prepared for attacks on airfields and {{52}}s.\\n\\nOn 19 April, the Netherlands declared a state of emergency. However, most civilians thought their country might not have a war. The Dutch hoped to avoid a war with terrible numbers of deaths. On 10 April, Britain and France again asked the Dutch to enter the war on the Allies\\' side. Again, the Dutch refused.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, a good defence was possible. The land helped the defender, and there was a strong {{54}} base, including an arms industry. The {{55}} lacked equipment and training, but the Dutch army was very weak.\\n\\nThe Germans had better equipment than the Netherlands. The modern German army had {{56}}s and dive bombers (such as the {{58}} Stuka). The Dutch army\\'s armoured forces were only 39 armoured cars and five tankettes, and an air force of biplanes.\\n\\nThe Dutch military had not got much new equipment since before the First World War. During the 1920s, the Dutch government limited their defense budget because of an economic {{62}} that lasted from 1920 until 1927. In that decade, only 1.5 million guilders per year was spent on equipment. Only in February 1936 was a bill passed creating a special 53.4 million guilder defence fund.\\n\\nThe lack of trained troops, a large professional organization, or good weapons made it hard to make the Dutch forces larger.  There was just enough {{63}} for the larger units. Light {{64}} {{65}}s were spread all over the country to delay enemy movement.\\n\\nThey had many pillboxes, about two thousand in number, but the lines were thin. Modern large {{66}}es like the Belgian fortress of Eben Emael did not exist. The only modern fortification was the one at Kornwerderzand.\\n\\nTotal Dutch forces were 48 {{69}}s of infantry, as well as 22 infantry battalions for border defence. In comparison, Belgium had 22 full divisions and 30 divisions when smaller units were included.\\n\\nAfter September 1939, the Dutch tried to improve the situation, but with little result. Germany delayed its deliveries of weapons. France did not want to sell weapons to an army that would not take its side.\\n\\nThe Dutch could not get weapons from the other possible source, the Soviet Union, because the Dutch did not recognize their {{71}} government. An attempt in 1940 to get Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.\\n\\nOn 10 May, the Dutch Army had a shortage of armour. Other countries had good armoured forces. The Netherlands had not been able to get 146 modern tanks. A single Renault FT 17 tank was all the Dutch had. It was no longer working by 1940.\\n\\nThere were two groups of armoured cars, each with a dozen Landsverk M36 or M38 vehicles; another dozen DAF M39 cars were being prepared. A single platoon of five Carden-Loyd Mark VI tankettes was all the armour they had.\\n\\nThe Dutch Artillery had 676 {{78}}s and {{79}}s: 310 Krupp 75 mm field guns; 52 105 mm Bofors howitzers, the only really modern pieces; 144 obsolete Krupp 125 mm guns; 40 150 mm sFH13\\'s; 72 Krupp 150 mm L/24 howitzers and 28 Vickers 152 mm L/15 howitzers.\\n\\nAs antitank-guns 386 Böhler 47 mm L/39s were available, but there were not enough. There were another three hundred old  6 Veld (57 mm) and 8 Staal (84 mm) field guns. Only eight of the 120 modern 105 mm pieces ordered from Germany had been delivered at the time of the {{84}}. Most artillery was horse-drawn.\\n\\nThe Dutch Infantry used about 2,200 7.92 mm Schwarzlose M.08 machine guns, and eight hundred {{86}}s. Many of these were in the pillboxes; each battalion had a heavy machine gun company of twelve.\\n\\nThe Dutch infantry squads had a light machine gun, the M.20 Lewis machine gun of which about eight thousand were available. This weapon often jammed and it was not good for attacks. Most Dutch infantry had the Dutch Mannlicher rifle. This weapon had been used for over 40 years, and it was out of date, but the Dutch military did not have the money to replace it.\\n\\nThere were but six 80 mm {{89}}s for each regiment. This made it hard for the Dutch infantry to fight.\\n\\nDespite the Netherlands having the company of {{90}}, one of Europe\\'s largest producers of radio equipment, the Dutch army mostly used telephones. Only the Artillery had been given 225 radio sets.\\n\\nAfter the German attack on {{91}} and {{92}} in April 1940, when the Germans used large numbers of airborne troops, the Dutch were worried about a similar attack.\\n\\nTo stop this type of attack, five infantry battalions were put at the main ports and airbases, such as {{94}} airfield of Ypenburg and the Rotterdam airfield of Waalhaven. These were given AA-guns, two tankettes and twelve of the 24 operational armoured cars.  The Dutch put 32 {{97}}s throughout the country and fifteen trains to help make troop movements easier.\\n\\nThe Dutch air force had 155 aircraft: 28 Fokker G.1 twin-engine destroyers; 31 {{99}} and seven Fokker D.XVII fighters; ten twin-engined Fokker T.V, fifteen Fokker C.X and 35 Fokker C.V light bombers, twelve Douglas DB-8 dive bombers (used as fighters) and seventeen Koolhoven FK-51 reconnaissance aircraft. 74 of the 155 aircraft were biplanes. Of these aircraft 125 worked.\\n\\nThe air force school used three Fokker D.XXI, six Fokker D.XVII, a single Fokker G.I, a single Fokker T-V and seven Fokker C.V, along with several training airplanes. Another forty aircraft were the marine air service along with about an equal number of reserve and training craft.\\n\\nThere was a Dutch military aircraft industry, consisting of Fokker and Koolhoven. However, the Dutch military could not afford new planes.\\n\\nThe Dutch Army was poorly equipped. It was also poorly trained. There was little experience leading forces bigger than the battalion level. From 1932 until 1936, the Dutch Army did not hold summer field exercises to save money. Also, soldiers lacked many skills. Until 1938, those who were joined only served for 24 weeks, just enough to receive basic infantry training. That same year, service time was increased to eleven months. There was not many professional military staff. In 1940 there were only 1206 professional officers.\\n\\nMost available time was spent constructing defences. During this period, {{108}} shortages limited live fire training, and units were not organized. In May 1940, the Dutch Army was not ready for battle. It could not do a major attack or move around on the battlefield.\\n\\nGerman generals and Hitler thought that the Dutch military was weak. They expected that {{109}} could be captured in about three to five days.\\n\\nIn the 17th century, the {{111}} had developed a defensive system called The Dutch Water Line. It could protect all major cities in the west by {{113}} part of the countryside. In the early 19th century this line was shifted to the east, beyond {{115}}. Later, fortresses were built.\\n\\nThis new position was called the New Holland Water Line. The line was given new pillboxes in 1940. The line was below sea level. This allowed it to be flooded with a few feet of water. This was too shallow for boats, but deep enough to turn the soil into mud. The area west of the New Holland Water Line was called Fortress Holland (Dutch: Vesting Holland; German: Festung Holland). The eastern side was covered by Lake IJssel and the southern side protected by three rivers. It was expected to hold out for a long period of time.\\n\\nSome people thought the defences would protect the country for three months without any Allied help.  Before the war the intention was to move to this position, and hope that Germany would only travel through the southern provinces on its way to Belgium and leave Holland undamaged.\\n\\nIn 1939, this attitude made it impossible to negotiate with the Allies about defence. Proposals by German diplomats that the Dutch government would accept a German advance into the country were rejected.\\n\\nFrom September 1939 a more easterly Main Defence Line (MDL) was built. This second defensive position was dug on orders from the commander of the Field Army, Lieutenant-General Jan Joseph Godfried baron van Voorst tot Voorst. This line was extended by a southern part between the river Maas and the Belgian border. In the south the goal was to delay the Germans so that the French could advance.\\n\\nFourth and Second Army Corps were put at the Grebbe Line; Third Army Corps were put at the Peel-Raam Position with the Light Division behind it to cover its southern side. Brigade A and B were positioned between the Lower Rhine and the Maas. First Army Corps was a reserve in the Fortress Holland, the southern edge of which was protected by another ten battalions and the eastern side by six battalions. All these lines were protected by pillboxes.\\n\\nIn front of this Main Defence Line was the IJssel-Maaslinie. It had pillboxes and fourteen \"border battalions\". Late in 1939 General Van Voorst tot Voorst wanted to use the rivers as a defence. He proposed a battle at the crossing sites near {{119}} and Gennep to force the German divisions to use a lot of their energy before they had reached the MDL.\\n\\nThis was deemed too risky by the Dutch government and General Reijnders. The Government wanted the army to resist at the Grebbe Line and Peel Raam Position, and then fall back to the Fortress Holland. Reijnders was not given full military authority in the defence zones. On 5 February 1940 he resigned because of these disagreements with his superiors. He was replaced by General Henry G. Winkelman who decided that in the north the Grebbe Line would be where the battle was to be fought, partly because it would be easier to counterattack.\\n\\nDuring the Phoney War the Dutch said they were neutral. In secret, the Dutch military talked with both Belgium and France to organize a common defence to a German invasion. This failed because of differences of opinion about which strategy to follow.\\n\\nBelgium, though it said it was neutral, had made arrangements for working with Allied troops. This made it more difficult for the Dutch to make arrangements with the Belgians. He did not approve of a plan by Van Voorst tot Voorst to occupy the \"Orange Position to form a continuous line with the Belgian lines.\\n\\nWhen Winkelman took over command, he proposed on 21 February that Belgium would set up a connecting line with the Peel Raam Position along the Belgian part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart. The Belgians refused to do this unless the Dutch sent in new troops in {{124}}. The Dutch had no forces available. Repeated Belgian requests to defend the Orange Position were refused by Winkelman.\\n\\nTherefore, the Belgians decided to withdraw, in an invasion, all their troops to their main defence line, the Albert Canal. This created a gap forty kilometres wide. The French were asked to fill it. Now the French Commander in Chief General Maurice Gamelin was more than interested in including the Dutch in his continuous line. But he would not stretch his supply lines that far unless the Belgians and Dutch would take the allied side. When both nations refused, Gamelin said he would occupy a position near {{127}}.\\n\\nWinkelman decided on 30 March to abandon the Peel-Raam Position after a German attack. He withdrew his Third Army Corps to the Linge. This Waal-Linge Position was planned to have pillboxes; the budget for pillboxes was increased with a hundred million guilders.\\n\\nIn addition to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army, a third force would operate on Dutch soil: the French 7th Army. Both the French and the Germans saw the possibility of a surprise attack.  For the Germans this would mean bypassing the Antwerp-{{131}} line.\\n\\nRapid forces were needed to protect important locations from the enemy. Long before the Germans did, the French had thought of using airborne troops to do speedy attacks. A naval division and an infantry division were set to go to Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing.\\n\\nFrench Commander in Chief General Maurice Gamelin feared the Dutch would surrender or accept German protection. He reassigned the former French strategic reserve, the 7th Army, to go in front of Antwerp. The force consisted of the 16th Army Corps, the 9th Motorised and the 4th Infantry Division; and the 1st Army Corps, consisting of the 25th Motorised Infantry Division and the 21st Infantry Division.\\n\\nThis army was later reinforced by the 1st Mechanised Light Division, an armoured division of the French Cavalry. Together with the two divisions in Zealand, seven French divisions were to be used.\\n\\nAlthough the French troops would have more motorised units than the Germans, they could not hope to reach their places in the battle before the enemy did. Their only prospect of beating the Germans was using rail transport.\\n\\nThey would have to build up their forces near Breda. They needed the Dutch troops in the Peel-Raam Position to delay the Germans for a few extra days to allow French forces to move in and dig trenches. These consisted of the reconnaissance units of the armoured and motorised divisions, with armoured cars. These would be put into two task forces.\\n\\nDuring the plans for Fall Gelb the idea of leaving the Fortress Holland alone was considered. The first plan of 19 October 1939 suggested a full occupation. In the version of 29 October it was proposed to limit the invasion to a line south of {{133}}. In the Holland-Weisung (Holland Directive) of 15 November it was decided to conquer the entire south, but in the north to advance no further than the Grebbe Line, and to occupy the Frisian Isles.\\n\\n{{135}} wanted a full capture of Holland as he needed the Dutch airfields to use against Britain. He was afraid the Allies might reinforce Fortress Holland and use the airfields to bomb German cities and troops. A swift defeat would also free troops for other sectors.\\n\\nOn 17 January 1940 they decided to conquer all of the Netherlands. However, few units were available for this task. The main effort of Fall Gelb would be made in the centre, between {{136}} and {{137}}. The attack at central Belgium was only a trick; and the attack at Fortress Holland only a trick as well.\\n\\nAlthough both the 6th and 18th Army were in place at the Dutch border, the first, larger force would move south of {{140}} to Belgium. This would leave just the 18th Army under General Georg von Küchler to attack the Dutch main force.\\n\\nOf all German armies in the battle, this was the weakest. It contained only four regular infantry divisions (the 207th, 227th, 254th and 256th Infantry Divisions), assisted by three reserve divisions (208th, 225th, and 526th Infantry Divisions). Six of these divisions were units created in August 1939 from territorial Landwehr units. They had few professional officers and little fighting experience.\\n\\nLike the Dutch Army, most soldiers (88%) lacked training. The seventh division was the 526th Infantry Division, which lacked combat training. The German divisions had 17,807 men, fifty percent larger than their Dutch counterparts. They had twice their firepower, but even so they did mot have enough men for a successful attack.\\n\\nTo add more men, the only German cavalry division, the 1st \\'\\'Kavalleriedivision\\'\\' was told to capture the weakly defended provinces east of the river IJssel. A landing in Holland near Enkhuizen was to be attempted, using barges. As both efforts were unlikely to do well, the regular divisions were reinforced by the {{149}} (including SS-Standarten Der Führer, Deutschland and Germania) and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. These would attack the Dutch fortified positions. Still this added only 1 division to the equation.\\n\\nTo ensure a victory the Germans used new methods. The Germans had trained two airborne divisions. The first of these, the 7. Flieger-Division, was paratroopers; the second, the 22nd \\'\\'Luftlande-Infanteriedivision\\'\\', of airborne infantry. The airborne troops would capture the airfields around The Hague, and then capture that government, together with the Dutch High Command and Queen Wilhelmina.\\n\\nThe plan, Fall Festung, had been developed by Hitler. If the first attack did not succeed, the bridges at {{153}}, {{154}} and Moerdijk would be captured to allow a mechanised force to move in. This force was to be the German 9th Panzer Division.  They were the only German armoured division having just two tank battalions. the total number of tanks in the group was 141. The plan was for them to go through a gap in the Dutch lines created by the 254th and 256th Infantry Divisions. Then they would join up with them, forming the XXVI. Armeekorps. At the same time, an attack would be made against the Grebbe Line in the east by the 207th and 227th Infantry Divisions, united to form X. Armeekorps, to fight the Dutch Army. The plan was to force the Dutch back to the east front of the Fortress Holland or beyond. If the Dutch did not surrender on the first day, the Eighteenth Army would attack Fortress Holland on the third day from the south.\\n\\nThe German people and troops disliked the idea of going against Dutch neutrality. The Germans said the invasion was to stop the Allies from occupying the Low Countries. Some German officers did not like the Nazi government and were also unhappy with the invasion.\\n\\nOne of them was Colonel Hans Oster, a German intelligence officer. In March 1939 he began to pass information to his friend, a Dutch military officer in Berlin Major Gijsbertus J. Sas. This information included the German attack date.  Sas informed the Allies. Sas knowing the date of the attack on Denmark and Norway was not noticed. Though he said a German armoured division would try to attack the Netherlands and that there was a plan to capture the Queen, the Dutch defence plan was not changed.\\n\\nOn 4 May Sas warned that an attack was coming soon. When in the evening of 9 May Oster phoned his friend saying the attack would be soon, the Dutch troops were put on alert.\\n\\nOster was a leader of the German resistance from 1938 to 1943, and was one of those hanged after the 20 July 1944 bomb plot to kill Hitler.\\n\\nOn the morning of 10 May 1940, Germany attacked the Netherlands, {{161}}, {{162}} and Luxembourg.\\n\\nIn the night the Luftwaffe flew into Dutch lands. One group, Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4), attacked the Dutch airfields. Led by Oberst (Colonel) Martin Fiebig, KG 4 attacked the naval airfield at De Kooy, destroying 35 aircraft. Fiebig was shot down and spent five days as a Dutch {{167}}.\\n\\nKG 4 also attacked Amsterdam-Schiphol, where the Dutch lost a third of their medium bombers, and The Hague airfields where KG 4 destroyed half of the 21 defending fighters. KG 4 lost 11 Heinkel He 111 bombers on 10 May and three {{170}}s; KG 30 and 54 another nine bombers. Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) and Zerstörergeschwader 26 (ZG 26) shot down 25 Dutch aircraft for a loss of nine fighters, with Albert Kesselring\\'s Luftflotte 2 destroying 41.\\n\\nThe Dutch were left with just 70 aircraft by the end of the day. They continued to fight the Luftwaffe, shooting down 13 German fighter aircraft by 14 May.\\n\\nParatroopers were landed near the airfields. Dutch {{175}} shot down numerous Ju 52 transport planes. German Ju 52 losses in the battle were about 250 planes.\\n\\nThe attack on The Hague was a failure. The paratroopers did not capture the main airfield at Ypenburg in time for the airborne infantry to land in their Junkers. Five Landsverks, assisted by machine guns, destroyed the eighteen Junkers, killing many troops.\\n\\nWhen the airstrip was blocked by wrecks the remaining planes landed in meadows or on the beach, spreading out the troops. The small airfield of Ockenburg was captured by the Germans.\\n\\nThe airfield of Valkenburg was occupied. However, the landing strip was still being built and the water level had not yet been lowered: planes landing there sank in the soft soil.\\n\\nNone of the airfields could be used to land new troops. The paratroopers occupied Ypenburg but did not get into The Hague. They were blocked by Dutch troops. Early in the afternoon they fired on by three Dutch artillery batteries. Dutch artillery drove away the German troops from the other two airfields.\\n\\nThe attack on Rotterdam was much more successful. Twelve Heinkel He 59 seaplanes landed in the city. They captured the Willemsbrug, a {{186}} over the Nieuwe Maas. At the same time the military airfield of Waalhaven was attacked by airborne forces.\\n\\nHere an infantry battalion was close to the airfield. The paratroopers landed near them. A fight followed. The first group of Junkers suffered no losses and the transports continued to land. In the end the Dutch defenders were defeated. The Germans occupied IJsselmonde.\\n\\nThe Royal Netherlands Navy\\'s torpedo boats Z5 and TM 51 attacked the Willemsbrug.  The {{191}} HNLMS \\'\\'Van Galen\\'\\' sailed up the Nieuwe Waterweg to bomb the airfield, but the ship got bombed. A plan to send the gunboats HNLMS \\'\\'Flores\\'\\' and HNLMS \\'\\'Johan Maurits van Nassau\\'\\' was stopped.\\n\\nAt the Island of Dordrecht the Dordrecht bridge was captured but the Dutch fought on.  The long Moerdijk bridges were captured and fortified on the southern side.\\n\\n The Germans, doing a plan approved by Hitler, tried to capture the IJssel and Maas bridges. During the night of 10 May they approached the bridges. Most of these attempts failed and the bridges were blown up. The exception was the Gennep railway bridge.\\n\\nAn armoured train crossed it followed by a troop train, which unloaded an infantry battalion behind the defence line.\\n\\nGenerally German soldiers behaved in a civilised manner towards the Dutch population, buying food at the shops.\\n\\nAfter the failed assaults on the bridges, the German divisions began crossing over the rivers IJssel and Maas. The first attacks were destroyed by fire from the pillboxes.\\n\\nAt most places, bombing destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river by building pontoon bridges. At {{201}}, Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the attack and advanced to the Grebbe Line, followed by 207. Infanteriedivision.\\n\\nA withdrawal was planned for the first night after the invasion, in the darkness. Due to the rapid German advance a quick retreat was ordered at 06:45. The corps joined \"Brigade G\", six battalions already occupying the Waal-Linge line.\\n\\nThe Light Division, based at Vught, was the only force the Dutch Army had that could move about. Its withdrawal had been done a day early. Its regiments had reached the Noord river in the evening.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on the evening of the 10th, around 22:00, French troops using Panhard 178 armoured cars started to arrive at the Dutch border. After them, the French 1st Mechanised Light Division moved forward. Attempts to get the French to move forward with the Dutch troops towards Noord-Brabant did not work well.\\n\\nWhen a first attack had been stopped, an attack at the Main Defense Line was postponed because most artillery had not arrived. In the early evening, they attacked even though there was only one 105 mm battery.\\n\\nColonel Schmidt at 20:30 ordered the Peel-Raam Position to be abandoned. He told his troops to go to the west at a new line at the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal.\\n\\nIn the North, by the end of the day, 1. Kavalleriedivision had reached the line {{209}}–Groningen. They were delayed by Dutch teams blowing up 236 bridges. Dutch troop strength in that area was weak.\\n\\nIn the south, the six border battalions in the province of {{211}} delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army. Before noon {{212}} had surrendered. The Germans did not capture the main bridge intact. This delayed the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division until the next day.\\n\\nOn 11 May the Dutch commander General Winkelman had two goals. First of all he wanted to kill the German airborne troops. He thought that the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges would stop the movement of new Allied troops.\\n\\nThe second goal was to help the French army to make a strong defensive line in North Brabant.\\n\\nLittle was achieved this day. The attack by the Light Division against the airborne troops on IJsselmonde failed. The bridge over the river Noord was defended by the German paratroopers, and it was impossible to cross it. Several attempts to cross the river by boats were not that successful.\\n\\nAt 10:15, the Light Division was told to join the Dutch troops on the Island of Dordrecht. After killing German troops on the Island of Dordrecht the division was to advance into IJsselmonde over the Dordrecht bridge to reach Rotterdam.\\n\\nEarlier during the day, two attempts were made by Dutch battalions to attack the western side of the German line. The First Battalion tried to attack the bridge at Barendrecht into IJsselmonde. The second battalion tried to capture more land.\\n\\nAlthough its crossings were successful, the first battalion was attacked by the Germans. The second battalion had many men being taken prisoner.\\n\\nThen a French force and another Dutch border battalion attacked the southern Moerdijk bridge, but the armoured cars were bombed by German Stukas and had to retreat.\\n\\nIn Rotterdam, the Dutch failed to kill the German airborne troops from their bridge on the northern bank of the Maas. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. None of the attempts to kill the groups of 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces was successful.\\n\\nIn North Brabant, the situation got worse. The French commanders of the 7th Army had expected that Dutch fighting would give them four days to build up a defensive line near Breda. However, the best three divisions had been moved to the north and the remaining forces were retreating.\\n\\nThe withdrawal of the Peel Division from the Peel-Raam Position to the Zuid-Willemsvaart, a canal to the west, meant leaving behind their trenches and artillery for a totally unprepared line. The eastern bank of the canal was higher than the western bank, providing excellent cover for the attackers.\\n\\nOne part of the canal, near Heeswijk, was left undefended; as this area contained a bridge which was not destroyed, the Germans were able to cross the canal around 13:00.\\n\\nA second crossing at Erp, led to a collapse of the line. By the end of the 11th, the Germans had crossed the Zuid-Willemsvaart at most places and the Peel Division had fallen apart. The French refused to advance further to the northeast than Tilburg, apart from some armoured cars that went as far as Berlicum.\\n\\nWinkelman asked the British government to sent an Army Corps to add to allied positions in the area and bomb Waalhaven airfield.\\n\\nMotorised elements of SS Standarte \"Der Fuehrer\" had reached the southernmost part of the Grebbe Line, in front of the Grebbeberg, on the evening of the 10th. This Main Defense Line sector was protected by a line of outposts and two groups of infantry.\\n\\nAt about half past three in the morning of the 11th, German artillery started bombing the outposts. At dawn, two battalions of Der Fuehrer attacked. As the German bombing had cut the telephone lines, no artillery could be requested by the Dutch defenders.\\n\\nThe vegetation offered good cover for the attackers. At noon, the Germans broke a hole at the extreme north. By evening, all outposts were held by the Germans.\\n\\nThe commander of 2nd Army Corps, Major-General Jacob Harberts, did not realise that motorised SS troops had been involved in the attack. He thought that the outposts had surrendered to a small German force. He ordered a night attack by the single reserve battalion of 4th Division.\\n\\nThis attack was abandoned. However, heavy Dutch artillery fire caused the Germans to abandon their plans for a night attack.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the North, 1. Kavalleriedivision advanced through the province of {{219}}, reaching {{220}} in the evening. Most Dutch troops had been evacuated from the north.\\n\\nOn the morning of 12 May General Winkelman still had hope. He thought a defence line could be set up in North Brabant with the help of the French. He also expected that the Dutch could kill the German airborne forces. He was not aware of any danger to the Grebbe Line.\\n\\n9. Panzerdivision crossed the Meuse in the early morning of 11 May. It could not advance quickly over roads filled with infantry. The armoured division was told to join with the airborne troops as soon as the Peel-Raam Position had been captured by the infantry forces.\\n\\nBecause the German 6th Army was threatening its right side and there was no time to prepare a defence line, Gamelin ordered the 7th Army to withdraw its left side. 2e Brigade Légère Mécanique retreated to the south.\\n\\nThe 9th Panzer Division took Colonel Schmidt prisoner. The Dutch troops in the province lost all command. Shortly after noon the German armoured cars got thirty kilometres more to the west, cutting off the Fortress Holland from the Allied main force. At 16:45 they had reached the bridges.\\n\\nAt 13:35 Gamelin ordered a withdrawal to Antwerp of all French troops in North-Brabant.\\n\\nThe Light Division tried to recapture the Island of Dordrecht by advancing with four battalions with little artillery support. On its left side, where there was almost no enemies, the advance went well. The battalion on the right side ran into an attacking German battalion. In the street fighting the German troops blocked the battalion. The other Dutch units then halted their advance around noon. No attack was made that day.\\n\\nIn Rotterdam and around The Hague little was done against the paratroopers. Most Dutch commanders did not attack.  \\n\\nIn the east the Germans attacked the Dutch defenders on the Grebbeberg. After artillery bombing in the morning, at around noon a battalion of Der Fuehrer attacked the main line, occupied by a Dutch company.\\n\\nThe Germans got through the thin line. A second German battalion then attacked to the north. Dutch artillery, though equal in strength to the Germans, did not fire on the enemy infantry.\\n\\nDue to a lack of numbers, training, and heavy weapons, the attacks failed against the well-trained SS troops. By the evening the Germans had the area under their control. Spotting a weak point, one of the SS battalion commanders, Obersturmbannführer Hilmar Wäckerle, attacked. The defenders mostly abandoned their positions. The SS company became surrounded.\\n\\nThe earlier German advance later caused the main line to be abandoned for over two miles to the north because the troops there feared an attack from behind.\\n\\nThe Dutch knew that the forces on the Grebbe Line would not be strong enough to stop all attacks by themselves. They were intended to delay an attack long enough for new troops to be sent. In the late evening it was decided to attack from the north the next day.\\n\\nIn the North, the Wons position had a long perimeter of about nine kilometres, which gave space for retreating troops. On 12 May units with a combined strength of only two battalions were still present, so the line was weakly held. The first German unit to arrive broke through. This forced the defenders to withdraw to the Enclosure Dike.\\n\\nGeneral Winkelman ordered the artillery bin the Hoekse Waard to try to destroy the Moerdijk bridges and sent a team to Rotterdam to blow up the Willemsbrug. He also ordered the oil reserves of {{223}} at Pernis to be set on fire.\\n\\nThe Dutch government asked {{225}} for three British divisions to battle the Germans. The new prime minister said he did not have any reserves; however, three British torpedo boats were sent to Lake IJssel. Also, 2nd Welsh Guard battalion was prepared to be sent, but it was too late.\\n\\nThe German command was very happy with the day\\'s events. von Bock had requested another Army Corps. The French were retreating. von Bock decided to follow the French south towards Antwerp. Some forces would be sent to advance north with 254. Infanteriedivision, most of 9. Panzerdivision, and SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler.\\n\\nIn the early morning of 13 May General Winkelman told the Dutch government that there were serious problems. On land the Dutch had been cut off from the Allied front and no major Allied landings were planned by sea. Without support, there was no hope of successful resistance.\\n\\nGerman tanks might quickly pass through Rotterdam; Winkelman had already ordered all antitank-guns to be placed around The Hague, to protect the government. However, a collapse of the Dutch defences might still be prevented if attacks could seal off the southern front near Dordrecht and restore the eastern line at the Grebbeberg. Therefore, the cabinet decided to continue the fight, giving the general the power to surrender the Army when he thought he had to.\\n\\nQueen Wilhelmina was brought to safety; she departed around noon from Hoek van Holland, where a British Irish Guards battalion was present, on HMS Hereward, a British destroyer, and went to England.\\n\\nThe previous evening, the Queen\\'s only child and {{229}}, together with her husband and their children, had departed from IJmuiden on HMS Codrington  for {{231}}.\\n\\nAs the Queen was part of the government, when she left, the cabinet had to whether to follow her or remain. After many discussions it was decided to leave also: the ministers sailed at 19:20 from Hoek van Holland on HMS Windsor to form a {{233}} in London.\\n\\nThree Dutch merchant ships, escorted by British warships, transferred government gold and diamonds to the United Kingdom.\\n\\nWhile two tank companies of 9. Panzerdivision remained to pursue the French, the other four began to cross the Moerdijk bridge at 05:20. Two staff companies with tanks also went to the northern side. The Dutch attempted to block the German armour.\\n\\nAt around 06:00 the last medium bomber, a Fokker T. V,  dropped two bombs on the bridge. The one bomb that hit the bridge did not explode. The bomber was shot down. The Dutch tried to destroy the bridge by artillery fire, but the bridge was only slightly damaged. Attempts to flood the Island of Dordrecht failed.\\n\\nThe Light Division tried to advance to the west. However, two of the four battalions could not recapture the suburbs of Dordrecht. When the other two battalions approached the main road, they were met by a few dozen German tanks.\\n\\nThe battalions were hit by a Stuka bombing and they fled to the east. 47mm and 75 mm batteries halted the attack of the German tanks. The left part of the Light Division then withdrew to the Alblasserwaard at around 13:00.\\n\\nA tank company also tried to capture the Dordrecht, but it was ordered to retreat after heavy street fighting. in At least two Panzerkampfwagen IIs were destroyed and three tanks heavily damaged. All Dutch troops were withdrawn from the island in the night.\\n\\nGerman armoured forces advanced north over the Dordrecht bridge into IJsselmonde island. Three tanks, two PzKpfw. IIs and a Panzerkampfwagen III attacked the Barendrecht bridge into the Hoekse Waard. All of them were destroyed by a single 47 mm antitank-gun. Though the Germans did not make another attack, this area was abandoned by the Dutch troops.\\n\\nIn Rotterdam a last attempt was made to blow up the Willemsbrug. Two Dutch companies attacked the bridge. The bridge was reached and the fifty German almost surrendered. However, the attack was stopped because of heavy fire from the other side of the river.\\n\\nIn the North, the commander of 1. Kavalleriedivision, Major General Kurt Feldt, had to go over the Enclosure Dike because of a lack of ships. The main fortifications contained 47 mm antitank-guns. There was no cover for any attacker.\\n\\nOn 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20 mm anti aircraft battery. It had been Feldt\\'s intention to destroy the position by mortars, but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at {{239}}.\\n\\nSeveral air attacks on 13 May had little effect. In the late afternoon five sections tried to attack under cover of an artillery bombing, but soon fled after being fired upon.\\n\\nIn the East the Germans tried to attack the Grebbe Line by using the other division of X. AK, 227. Infanteriedivision. The line was in this area defended by the Dutch 2nd Infantry Division. Two German regiments were to attack. The 366. Infanterieregiment was hit by Dutch artillery fire and had to withdraw. This led to the failure of the attack by 227 Infanteriedivision.\\n\\nOn the south of the Grebbe Line, the Grebbeberg, the Germans were now using three SS battalions. During the evening and night of 12–13 May the Dutch had a dozen However, not all of these units could be put together to attack the main line.\\n\\nThis Dutch attack was delayed for several hours. When it started in the morning of 13 May, it ran into an attack by two battalions of Der Fuehrer. A fight followed in which the Dutch were beaten by the SS troops. Soon this resulted in a  withdrawal of the brigade. The Dutch lost when the Grebbeberg area was bombed by 27 {{240}}s.\\n\\nMeanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was sent into battle at the Grebbeberg. The first German attackers were stopped with serious losses. A second attack managed to get past the trench line, which then was captured after heavy fighting.\\n\\nThe Germans planned to attack and take the Rhenen line and the village of Achterberg. However, the Dutch had already disappeared.\\n\\nThe Stuka bombing scared the reserves at Rhenen. In the morning these troops left the battlefield because of German fire. In the late afternoon most of 4th Infantry Division was fleeing westwards.\\n\\nThe German had expected that the Dutch would attempt to fill any gaps in the line. The Dutch planned to send two regiments of the Dutch 3rd Army Corps north to fill any gaps.\\n\\nBut Dutch command had lost control, so they could not get their defences set up again. A  wide gap had appeared in the defences. At 20:30 Van Voorst tot Voorst ordered the three Army Corps to abandon the Grebbe Line and the Waal-Linge Position and to retreat.\\n\\nDespite his loss of hope and the power  he had been given to surrender the Army, General Winkelman avoided surrendering until he had to. He wanted to battle the German troops for as long as possible, to help the Allied war effort.\\n\\nIn the North, a German artillery bombardment of the Kornwerderzand Position began at 09:00. However, the German batteries were forced to move away after being fired on from the 15 cm. aft cannon of Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau. Feldt now decided to land on the coast of North-Holland.\\n\\nA few barges were found; only after the surrender was the crossing done. During this operation one barge sunk and the others got lost. Winkelman on 12 May ordered the defence of an \"Amsterdam Position\" along the North Sea Canal, but only weak forces were available.\\n\\nIn the East, the field army withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front. The new position had some problems. The flooding was mostly not yet ready and the earthworks had not yet been constructed.\\n\\nOn IJsselmonde the German forces prepared to cross the Maas in Rotterdam, which was defended by about eight Dutch battalions. Crossings would be attempted in two sectors. The main attack would take place in the centre of the city, with the German 9th Panzer Division advancing over the Willemsbrug.\\n\\nThen SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler would cross. East of Rotterdam, a battalion of the 16th Infantry Regiment of 22. Luftlandedivision would cross on boats.\\n\\nThe Germans decided to use air support. Kampfgeschwader 54, using Heinkel He 111 bombers, was shifted from Sixth to Eighteenth Army.\\n\\nGenerals Kurt Student and Schmidt wanted a limited air attack to temporarily stop the defences. However, Luftwaffe commander {{247}}, worried about his surrounded airborne troops, wanted a total {{248}} of Rotterdam.\\n\\nAt 09:00 a German messenger crossed the Willemsbrug to bring a message Schmidt to Colonel Pieter Scharroo, the Dutch commander of Rotterdam, demanding a surrender of the city. If an answer had not been received within two hours, severe destruction would be done.\\n\\nScharroo did not receive the message until 10:30. He did not want to surrender. He got a new message signed by Schmidt and that required an answer by 16:20. At 13:20 two groups of Heinkels arrived.\\n\\nSchmidt ordered red flares to be fired to signal that the bombing was to be stopped, but only the squadron from the southwest stopped its attack, after their first three planes had dropped their bombs.\\n\\nThe other 54 Heinkels dropped 1308 bombs, destroying the inner city and killing 814 civilians. The fires destroyed about 24,000 houses, making almost 80,000 people homeless.\\n\\nAt 15:50 Scharroo surrendered to Schmidt in person. Göring had ordered a second bombing of the city to be carried out unless the whole of Rotterdam was occupied. When Schmidt heard the order, he sent a message at 17:15 claiming the city was taken, but this was not true. The bombers were called back just in time.\\n\\nWinkelman at first intended to continue the fight. Bombings were not seen as a reason to surrender. The Hague could still fight off an armoured attack.\\n\\nHe got a message from Colonel Cuno Eduard Willem baron van Voorst tot Voorst, the commander of the city of {{251}}, that the Germans demanded its surrender. Messages were dropped by planes saying that only surrender would stop the city from being destroyed.\\n\\nWinkelman thought the Germans would bomb any city offering any resistance, Since he was told to avoid suffering and since the Dutch military was weak, he decided to surrender.\\n\\nAll army units were informed at 16:50 by of his decision and ordered to destroy their weapons and surrender to the nearest German units. At 17:20 the German envoy in The Hague was informed. At around 19:00 Winkelman gave a radio speech informing the Dutch people. This was also how the German command became aware the Dutch had surrendered.\\n\\nOn the morning of 14 May the commander of the Royal Dutch Navy, Vice-Admiral Johannes Furstner, left the country to continue the fight. Dutch naval vessels were generally not included in the surrender. Eight ships had already departed, some smaller vessels were sunk, and nine others sailed for England in the evening of 14 May. The Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau was sunk by German bombers while crossing.\\n\\nThe commander of the main Dutch naval port of {{254}}, Rear-Admiral Hoyte Jolles, decided that his base, with 10,000 troops, its own air service, and land defences, should continue to fight. Winkelman had to convince him to obey the surrender order. Large parts of the Dutch Army did not want to accept the surrender.\\n\\nAt 05:00 on 15 May a German messenger reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord for a meeting with von Küchler to make a written surrender. Winkelman surrendered the army, naval and air forces. The document was signed at 10:15\\n\\nThe province of Zealand not part of the surrender. Fighting continued alongside French troops. The Dutch forces in the province had eight full battalions of army and naval troops.\\n\\nThey were commanded by Rear-Admiral Hendrik Jan van der Stad.  The area was under naval command because of the naval port of {{258}} on the island of {{259}}. The northern islands of the province were almost undefended apart from some platoons.\\n\\nThe defence of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, the Dutch part of Flanders, was left to the Allies. The main Dutch army forces were in {{261}} east of Walcheren. They tried to block this route to Vlissingen.\\n\\nZuid-Beveland was connected to the coast of North Brabant. At its eastern end, Bath Position was defended by an infantry battalion. At its western end was the Zanddijk Position, occupied by three battalions.\\n\\nAfter on 10 May three French motorised units went to North Brabant. From 11 May the area was reinforced by two French infantry divisions: the 60e Division d\\'Infanterie, a B-class division, and the newly formed naval 68e Division d\\'Infanterie. Part of their equipment was brought by ship.\\n\\nMost troops remained where two of the eight Dutch battalions and two border companies were located. Only two French regiments were sent to the northern bank.\\n\\nOn 13 May the Dutch troops were placed under French command and 68e Division d\\'Infanterie was transferred to the 7th Army.\\n\\nThere was poor communications, misunderstandings and disagreements between the Dutch and the French. The Dutch considered the Bath and Zanddijk Positions to be defendable because of the flooding.  However, the French commander General Pierre-Servais Durand wanted his troops hidden behind obstacles.\\n\\nOn the evening of 13 May one regiment, the 271e of 68e Division d\\'Infanterie, occupied the Canal through Zuid-Beveland. The 224e of 60 Division d\\'Infanterie stayed in the area separating the island of {{264}} from Zuid-Beveland. The Allied forces were not grouped together enough, which enabled the Germans to defeat them even though they had less men.\\n\\nOn 14 May the Germans had occupied almost all of North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d\\'Infanterie, which was destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom.  The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position weakened by news that Winkelman had surrendered. Many decided that it was useless that Zealand kept fighting as the last remaining province.\\n\\nAn artillery bombing on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to leave. Then the troops left.\\n\\nIn the morning of 15 May SS-Standarte Deutschland approached the Zanddijk Position. A first attack around 08:00 on the northern sector was stopped, as the Germans had to advance over a narrow dike. However, the bombing caused the battalions in the main positions to flee, and the entire line was abandoned around 14:00.\\n\\nOn 16 May SS-Standarte Deutschland approached the Canal through Zuid-Beveland. The French 271e Régiment d’Infanterie was partly dug in and helped by three Dutch battalions. An air bombing was done that morning. The first German crossings around 11:00 led to a complete collapse of the defence. On 16 May the island of Tholen was captured. On 17 May {{267}} was captured.\\n\\nThe commanders of the Dutch troops on South-Beveland refused commands to attack the Germans. On 17 May a night attack at 03:00 failed. The Germans now demanded the surrender of the island. When this was refused they bombed Arnemuiden and Flushing. {{269}}, the province\\'s capital city, was shelled by artillery, its inner city partially burning down.\\n\\nThe heavy bombing made the French defenders lose hope. The Germans managed to capture a bridge around noon. The few Dutch troops on Walcheren, about three companies, stopped fighting.\\n\\nIn the evening the  Germans threatened to attack the French forces in Flushing, but most troops were evacuated over the Western Scheldt.\\n\\nAfter {{270}} had surrendered on 18 May, Zeeuws-Vlaanderen was the last remaining unoccupied Dutch territory. On orders of the French, all Dutch troops were withdrawn on 19 May to {{271}} in Belgium. On 27 May all of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen had been occupied.\\n\\nFollowing the Dutch defeat, Queen Wilhelmina established a government-in-exile in England. The German occupation began on 17 May 1940. It would be five years before the entire country was liberated. Over 210,000 Dutch people became victims of war, including 104,000 Jews and other minorities, who were killed because of their race (genocide). Another 70,000 more Dutch people died from poor nutrition or limited medical services.',\n",

After the invasion turned out to be a failure, the Cuban Missile Crisis began.  During the crisis, Cuba ordered a lot of {{39}}s from the Soviet Union.

       "  'text': 'Diocletian (Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus, about 245 to aboout 312) was {{0}} from 20 November 284 to 11 May 305. Diocletian ended the period known as the {{1}} (235–284). He worked to return Rome to its former glory by making changes in key areas.\\n\\nReligion: He persecuted {{2}}s, {{3}} more than any other emperor. He imposed the traditional {{4}} religion of the Romans.\\n\\nEconomy: Recognizing a {{5}} drain from the western Mediterranean to the east, he tried to stop the {{7}} of the region by legislation. This did not work. He decreed that coins could only be made of gold or silver, stopping the trend of using lead in their creation. He made the tax system work better.\\n\\nMilitary: Diocletian changed the army from the traditional {{8}} defense. He put small outposts of soldiers on the border. He got local soldiers from the border regions along the Rhine and {{10}} rivers. These soldiers farmed and lived with their families in a village atmosphere. They lit signal fires on signal towers to warn other outposts of possible invasion by Germans from across the border. These outpost soldiers got regular pay from Rome for their services. He allowed soldiers to move up through the ranks by \"military credits\" earned by years of loyal service and by actions on the field of battle.\\n\\nDiocletian established a form of government known as the tetrarchy. In this, the Empire was organised into four parts, each ruled by a co-emperor. Diocletian took charge of the eastern empire. The senior co-emperor was Maximian Augustus, a fellow officer. He took charge of the western empire. Later, two junior co-emperors were added: {{11}} and Constantius Chlorus.\\n\\nFinally, in 305, the two senior emperors {{12}}d and {{13}}d, and the two juniors rose to the rank of Augustus. They in turn were supported by two juniors: Severus II in the west under Constantius, and Maximinus in the east under Galerius. In this way, the Tetrarchy showed how it could reproduce itself.\\n\\nThese men were from the Roman province of {{14}}, several in the city of Sirmium, which would become one of the four capitals under this system. From the time of {{16}} (81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian provinces had been the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions.\\n\\nIn the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians came to dominate the army\\'s senior officer echelons. Ultimately, the Illyrian officer class seized control of the state itself.\\n\\nThe four Tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire. They faced {{17}} and the Germanic tribes. Also, there were many tribes from the eastern steppe which presented at the Rhine and {{19}}.\\n\\nThe four centres are known as the \\'Tetrarchic capitals\\'. Although Rome ceased to be the operational capital, it was still the nominal capital of the entire empire. It had its own Prefect of the City, an idea later copied in {{20}}. The four Tetrarchic capitals were:\\n\\nAquileia, a port on the Adriatic coast, and {{23}} (modern {{24}}, in northern England near the {{25}} tribes), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.\\n\\nIn terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division between the four Tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a \\'war theatre\\'. Each Tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective {{26}}, each supervising several Vicarii, the governors-general in charge of another new administrative level, the civil diocese. \\nFor a listing of the provinces, now known as {{29}}, within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see {{30}}.\\n\\nIn the West, the Augustus Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his Caesar, Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the Augustus Diocletian and his Caesar, Galerius, were much more flexible.\\n\\nDiocletian\\'s reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government, and stabilized the empire economically and militarily. This helped the empire to remain intact for another hundred years, despite having seemed near the brink of collapse in Diocletian\\'s youth.\\n\\nWeakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily {{31}} the position. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the {{32}}n coast, tending to his {{33}} gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of {{34}}.\\n\\nMaximian attempted to return to power. Diocletian ordered him to step down permanently. Finally, Maximian was forced to commit {{35}}, and the tetrarchy began to unravel. Diocletian died in despair.',\n",

Most notably, he wrote several {{9}}s during his life, which have since been interpreted and sung in many different ways by different people. He is considered to be the most popular and influential poet of the {{10}} language.\\n\\nHe was born in 1796 in Akbarabad (present {{11}}). His father Abdullah Beg Khan and uncle Nasrullah Beg Khan were in the Army. Mirza Ghalib become orphaned when he was just 5 years old. He lived with his uncle for 4 years, when his uncle too died.  \\n\\nHe started saying sher in Agra itself. He married the daughter of Nawab Ilahi Baksh \\'Maaroof\\' and therefore moved to Delhi. In Delhi he devoted his full concentration to poetry. Soon he mastered the Persian language. So that no one should call him be-ustad ( without a teacher) he fabricated a story that he had an Iranian teacher Abdul Samad live in house for two years to teach him Farsi. Ghalib was always proud of his Farsi poetry but he is known more by his Urdu prose and poetry.  \\n\\nHe always lived his life lacking money. After 1857 the support from the Royal durbar stopped. The pension from the {{12}} was stopped because he was suspected of supporting the rebels. He even traveled to Calcutta to restart the pension but to no avail.  \\nHe went to the Nawab of Rampur, who promised him Rupees 200 if he lived in Rampur and Rs. 100 if he lived anywhere else. His pension was resumed 3 years after that, but all that money was used up for paying old debts. Ghalib died in 1869.     \\n\\nNot only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib. His letters gave foundation to the easy and popular Urdu. Before Ghalib, letter writing in Urdu was highly ornamental. He made his letters \"talking\" by using words and sentences as if he is talking to the reader. According to him \\n\"sau kos say ba-zabaan-e-qalam baateiN kiya karo aur hijr meiN visaal kay ma-zay liya karo\" \\n[ from hundred of miles talk with the tongue of the pen and enjoy the joy of meeting even when you are separated] \\nHis letters were very informal, some times he will just write the name of the person and start the letter. He himself was very humorous and also made his letter very interesting. He said  \\n\"maiN koshish karta hooN keH koi aisi baat likhooN jo pa-Rhay kHoosh ho jaaye\" \\n[ I want to write the lines that whoever reads those should enjoy it] \\nWhen the third wife of one of his friends died, he wrote... \\n\"Allah allah aik woH log haiN jo teen teen dafaH iss qaid say chhooT chu-kaiN haiN aur aik hum haiN keH aik ag-lay pachas baras say jo phaNsi ka phaNda ga-lay meiN paRha hai to naH phaNda hi TuT-ta hai naH dum hi nikalta hai\" \\n[Allah Allah, there are some among us who have been freed from the prison three times and I have for the past 50 years this rope around my neck neither this rope breaks nor it takes my life] \\nSome scholars says that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu literature even only on the basis of his letters.  \\n\\nIn Urdu ghazals, along with the love and beauty Ghalib added all the facets of life. Because of him the canvas of Urdu ghazal became very extended.  \\n\\nSince Ghalib was very occupied with Persian, his earlier shers used difficult words and his flights of imagination was such that... \\n\"yaa to aap sam-jhay yaa kHuda sam-jhay\" \\n[ either you (Ghalib) understand or the God understand]  \\n\\nGhalib was not a philosopher but he questioned things around him. \\njub  keH tujh bin nahiN koi maujood \\nphir yeH hungaamaH ai kHuda kya hai \\n[ when there is no one besides you; \\nthen oh God why is this pandemonium]  \\n\\nOne also find naughtiness in his writings, he makes fun of every thing and everybody including himself.  \\njiss meiN laakhoN baras ki hooreiN hoN \\naisi jannat ka kya ka-ray koi \\n[ when the women are million years old \\nwhat i will do with that paradise]  \\n\\nBut Ghalib\\'s sher not only have immediate effect on the heart but it makes you think too. \\naah ko chahiye aik umr asar ho-nay tak \\nkaun jeeta hai teri zulf kay sar ho-nay tak. \\n\\nhum nay mana keH tagHaful naH karo-gay lekin \\nkHaak ho jaaayeN-gay tum ko kHabar ho-nay tak. \\n\\ndaame hur  mauj meiN hai hulqa-e-sad kaam nihaNg \\ndekheiN kya guz-ray hai qat-ray peH guhar ho-nay tak.\\n\\nTarze-Nigarish \"طرز نگارش\" By Dr Abdul haq',\n",

       "  'text': 'British Rail was the national {{0}} company in the {{1}}, from 1948, when the railways were {{2}}, until 1997, when it was {{3}}.\\n\\nThe rail transport system in Great Britain started to grow in the 19th century. It was very close together, had many small \\'branch lines\\', and many competing firms. Four of these lines were {{4}}\\'s Staines and West Drayton Railway, the Sheppey Light Railway in {{7}}, the {{8}} Cambrian Railways and Welsh Highland Railway.\\n\\nDuring {{11}}, the railways were run by the government, until 1921. Railways Act 1921 merged most of the minor lines, like the Cambrian Railways, into the four biggest firms, who took them over. Complete nationalisation had been considered but was rejected until the Transport Act 1947. The Cambrian Railways joined the {{14}} (GWR). The Staines and West Drayton Railway had already been taken over by the GWR many years earlier.\\n\\nSome of the lines were to be under shared ownership and jointly run by some of the Big Four railway firms. These lines included the jointly owned Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GN) between the LMS and the {{17}} in eastern {{18}}, and the LMS and LNER  owned Cheshire Lines Committee in {{20}} and {{21}}. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJ) became owned by the LMS and the {{23}} in south-western {{24}}. {{25}} and LMS also jointly ran some lines in outer {{27}}.\\n\\nThe {{28}} area railway firms, such as the {{29}}, which become part of London Underground in 1933, were not merged. {{31}} lines like the {{32}}, narrow-gauge railways like the Ffestiniog Railway, and some light railways like the West Sussex Railway were also excluded. The {{36}} (LPTB), who run London Underground, was a state-run firm.\\n\\nAfter the smaller firms were merged in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921, there were four large regional railway companies. The Big 4 were the {{38}} (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the {{40}} (LNER) and the Southern Railway (SR). The Transport Act 1947 made provision for the {{43}} of the network.\\n\\nThe Welsh Highland Railway had been deemed unnecessary and too costly to run. It was closed in 1937. The {{45}} had caused damage to all the railways. They had lost a large part of their trains, buildings and equipment.\\n\\nThe Transport Act 1947 set out the {{47}} of the rail network, as part of a plan by Clement Attlee\\'s {{49}} Government to nationalise public transport. The London Underground, some industrial lines and some remaining light railways like Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway were again excluded. For a short time, during {{52}}, the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway line was taken over by the military. After the war the line re-opened to public use in 1946. The Bicester Military Railway had been built by the government in 1941.\\n\\nThe Transport Act 1947 took effect on 1 January 1923. By that date most of the mergers had taken place, some from the previous year. The Railway Magazine in its issue of February 1923 dubbed the new companies as \"The Big Four of the New Railway Era\".\\n\\nThese \"Big Four\" were:\\n\\nSee also a list of railway companies involved in the 1923 grouping.\\n \\n\\nThe nationalised Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) ran the railways in {{59}} from 1948 until 1966. They were then taken over by Translink and called {{61}}, also known as Northern Ireland Railways ().\\n\\nThe government of {{62}} and {{63}} ran the former Great Northern Railway jointly under a Great Northern Railway Board until 1958. Most of the lines in the west of Northern Ireland were closed in the 1960s.\\n\\nIn 1955, a major modernisation programme costing £1.2 billion was authorised by the government. The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes occur as {{67}} were scrapped 1968, in favour of diesel trains and electric trains. Freight now replaced passengers as the main source of business. One third of the network was closed by the highly critical Beeching report of the 1960s.\\n\\nA major railway survey in April 1961 was used in the writing of a government report on the future of the network. This report was called The Reshaping of British Railways. It was published by the BRB in March 1963 as (\"the Beeching Axe\"). A third of all passenger trains would be scrapped and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would be closed.\\n\\nInterCity (or, in the earliest days, the hyphenated Inter-City) was introduced by British Rail in 1966 as a brand-name for its long-haul express passenger services (see British Rail brand names for a full history).\\n\\nPassenger levels fell steadily from the late {{74}} to the late {{75}}, but experienced a sharp increase after the introduction of the high-speed {{76}} trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\\n\\nBetween 1934 and 1975 the Northern line ran the {{78}} as its Highbury Branch. London Underground gave it to British Rail in 1975,\\n\\nBefore the sectorization of BR in 1982 the system was split into regions. Working around London, they were London Midland Region (Marylebone, Euston, St Pancras and Broad Street), Southern Region (Waterloo, Victoria, Chairing Cross, Holborn Viaduct, Cannon Street and London Bridge), Western Region (Paddington) and Eastern Region (King\\'s Cross, Moorgate, Broad Street, Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street). This was perceived to be a source of inefficiency, so sectorization made the regions into a single organisation covering all commuter services.  At the same time {{85}} took over express services and {{86}} took over regional services. The group was originally called Provincial.\\n\\nBR built 2537 steam locomotives from 1948 to 1960, some to pre-nationalisation designs and some to its own, new, standard designs. Eventually BR chose to end the use of steam trains in 1968.\\n\\nThe official report known as the \"Modernisation Plan\" of December 1954 was intended to bring the {{87}} into the 20th century. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety and line capacity, by making the railways more attractive to passengers and freight operators. The important areas were:\\n\\nLong-distance trains from Marylebone began to be cut back from 1958 after the line was given from BR Midland Western to the BR Midland Region. Then BR Midland Region thought it was an unnecessary rival of their Midland Main Line. By 1960 there were no daytime trains running to destinations north of Nottingham and only a few still ran at night. Many Express services were cut. By 1963, local stopping services beyond Aylesbury were cut. In 1965 {{91}} services were ended. Between 1963 and 1966 only a few remaining long distance services stayed in use. A large part of the former Great Central Railway was closed as part of the \\'Beeching axe\\'. This meant that Marylebone was now used only by local trains to Aylesbury and High Wycombe. After the 1960s, lack of investment meant the station itself became run down.\\n\\nSome of the early models were of poor quality and design, but many later kinds proved their worth in time.\\n\\n{{94}} diesel trains were chosen to operate on the services from {{95}} usually to places such as {{96}}, {{97}} and {{98}} which are on the Chiltern Main Line and Great Central Main Line (now the London to Aylesbury Line). Strangely, the 115 were under Table 115 in the British Rail timetable. They were similar to {{102}},  but were superior as the class had larger windows, better seats, lights and wall surfaces. Both classes were made in the early 1960s.\\n\\nThe {{103}} (originally Brush Type 4) is a class of British railway diesel-electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by {{105}}. Their reliable and trusted service lasted well in to the 2000s.\\n\\nBritish Rail gave Class 52 to the class of 74 large Type 4 diesel-hydraulic {{108}}s built for the Western Region of {{110}} between 1961 and 1964. All were given two-word names, with the first word being Western, and so the type was nicknamed Westerns.\\n\\nSome of the early models were of poor quality and design, but many later kinds proved their worth in time.\\n\\nThe {{111}} (or 3D) versatile diesel-electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh in 1962.\\n\\nThe British Rail Class 423 (or 4Vep) electrical multiple units were built by BR at {{117}} Works from 1967 to 1974. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and mostly found working outer suburban services in South London, and rural services in {{119}} and {{120}}, up to replacement in 2005.\\n\\nThe {{121}} is a type of {{122}}. They are also known as Blue Train units, since they were originally painted blue all over. They were first used in 1960 for the electrification of the North Clyde and the Cathcart Circle lines in {{125}}.\\n\\nThe {{126}} electro-diesel locomotives are very unusual in that they can operate from a 750 V DC {{128}} supply, but also have a {{129}} to allow them to work on non-electrified routes.\\n\\nThe {{130}} was the standard {{131}} built during the 1960s. It was made after the repeated testing of the earlier classes like the {{132}} and  {{133}}. The tests led to a much improved loco design.\\n\\nThe {{134}} is a type of {{135}} (AC) {{136}} (EMU) built in 1966–1974 intended for use on outer-suburban passenger services. It was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed to the British Rail Mark 2  body shell, and also the last with slam doors. Their passenger seats were an improvement on former types.\\n\\n{{139}} {{140}}s were built by {{141}} at {{142}} Works from 1976 to 1977, thus the first second-generation EMUs to be constructed for British Rail. They were capable of both drawing power via 25 kV AC overhead, or 750 V DC third-rail. They were the first units in Britain to have fully automatic couplers which allowed both physical coupling and also the connection of control electric and air supplies to be carried out without the driver\\'s need to leave the cab. Their passenger seats were also an improvement on former types.\\n\\nDuring the late 1950s, railways continued to worsen, and in 1959 the government acted, limiting the amount the BTC could spend on British Rail.\\n\\nThe government proposed that many services could be provided more cheaply by {{145}}es, and said that most abandoned rail services would have their places taken by bus services. Only main lines would be untouched. Many other minor lines would be cut back or scrapped.\\n\\nThe {{146}} Lord Beeching saw South Wales as a failing industrial region. So it lost the majority of its network. Since 1983 it has experienced a major rail revival, with new stations such as Llanharan reopening. Four lines reopened within 20 miles (32 km) of each other: Abercynon–Aberdare, Barry–Bridgend via , Bridgend–Maesteg and the Ebbw Valley Line via Newbridge.\\n\\nThe station at Laurencekirk on the mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen was shut in 1967, but 42 years later in May 2009 it reopened. Other reopened stations include ,  and  – all closed in the mid-1960s.\\n\\nHaddenham in {{158}} lost its little-used station in 1963, but a more popular station opened in 1987 as the town grew.\\n\\nA major part of the report proposed that British Rail electrify some major main lines and the use of containerised freight traffic instead of outdated and uneconomic wagon-load traffic. Some of these plans were eventually adopted, however, such as the creation of the {{160}} concept and further electrification of the {{161}} from {{162}} to {{163}} in 1974. Also the staffs\\' terms and conditions were improved over time.\\n\\nSince the Beeching cuts of the {{164}}, road traffic levels grew heavily in some areas. This has come close to gridlock. Furthermore, in recent years there have been record high levels of passengers on the railways. A modest number of the railway closures have therefore been reversed.\\n\\nIn addition a small but significant number of closed stations have reopened, and passenger services been restored on lines where they had been closed or removed. Many of these were in the urban {{165}} and towns where Passenger Transport Executives have a role in promoting local passenger rail use.\\n\\nA notable reopening was the Robin Hood Line in {{168}}, between Nottingham and Worksop via Mansfield, which reopened in the early {{172}}. Before the line reopened, {{173}} had been the largest town in Britain without a railway station.\\n\\nProfits from the {{174}}s began to fall in the early 1980s. In 1983, the civil servant Sir David Serpell wrote what became known as the Serpell Report. He wanted even more cutbacks.\\n\\nIn the early 1980s there was a proposal to close Marylebone and divert British Rail services via {{178}} into nearby {{179}}. There was also a plan to extend the {{180}} to {{181}}, so {{182}} trains via Amersham would be sent to {{183}}. {{184}} was to be converted into a bus and coach station. London Underground said the {{185}} could not cope with any more trains and was full up. However these plans were deemed stupid and clumsy, and were quietly dropped.\\n\\nThe funding of BR was reduced so they created the cheaper Pacer trains. The {{186}} is a {{187}}, part of the {{188}} family of {{189}} introduced between 1985 and 1986. They originally worked around {{190}} but were later transferred to {{191}}. It was made out of bus parts put on to lorry chassis and train wheels. Earlier units proved to be unreliable, but later units were of a better design.\\n\\nThe British Rail Class 156 \"Super-{{192}}\"  {{193}} were built from 1987 to 1989 to replace elderly First Generation \"Heritage\" DMUs (like the {{195}}) and locomotive-hauled passenger trains.\\n\\nAs funding increased before privatisation the successful {{196}} {{197}} was made. It is a type of {{198}} (DMU) train. They were built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by {{199}} at their {{200}}.\\n\\nOn 12 December 1988, three commuter trains crashed, just south-west of Clapham junction station, in {{201}}. 35 people died and more than 100 were injured. British Rail\\'s 30-year-old vintage Mark 1 carriages were found out to be dangerous and the broken signalling equipment was fixed and improved.\\n\\nThe British {{205}} under {{206}} said that privatisation would help passenger services, but this did not happen until much later.\\n\\nThe Scottish Assembly Government have re-opened the lines between {{207}} and {{208}}, Alloa and {{210}} and is working on a link from {{211}} to {{212}}. The biggest line-reopening project is the former Waverley railway Edinburgh to Borders line.\\n\\nThe Welsh Assembly Government has re-opened the Vale of Glamorgan Line between Barry Bock and {{216}} in 2005. The Ebbw Valley Line reopened between Ebbw Vale and {{219}} in the year 2008. It will later go on to services to Newport in Gwent in 2011. The Barry–Bridgend route was closed after the Beeching report of March 1963. The line\\'s passenger service was officially shut down in June 1964, but freight continued until the late 1990s.\\n\\nSome English stations like {{223}} and {{224}} were reopened after privatisation.\\nYet more stations were reopened by British Rail in Scotland, England and Wales before privatisation when the railway was run properly.\\n\\nTrain fares cost more than under British Rail.\\n \\n\\nRegional Railways was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail. It was created in the year 1982. It finished operation in 1996, two years after privatisation. In the privatisation of British Rail, InterCity trains were divided up into several franchises. The Caledonian Sleeper are transferred to {{229}}, now {{230}}.\\n\\nSince privatisation, the number of companies has changed a number of times as rules have changed and the areas covered altered. The companies that took over passenger rail services include:\\n\\n----\\n\\nSix sub-brands also occurred in the early 2000s:\\n\\nWales and Borders, now part of {{232}}.\\n\\nWessex Trains, now part of {{234}}.\\n\\n Silverlink Metro, now {{236}}.\\n\\n Silverlink County, now part of {{238}}.\\n\\n West Anglia, now part of {{240}}.\\n\\n Great Northern Electrics,  now part of {{242}}.\\n\\nThe British Rail \"double arrow\" logo was said to show  direction of travel on a double track railway on a railway map and was nicknamed \"the arrow of indecision\". It is now employed as a general symbol on street signs in {{244}}, but not in {{245}}, denoting railway stations, and as part of the Association of Train Operating Companies (A.T.O.C.)\\'s joint-managed {{247}} brand, still being printed on railway tickets.\\n\\nSometimes strikes happened among British Rail staff, over staff pay, safety, working hours and alike. There were several strikes in the late 1970s, but decreased after privatisation. There were also several other strikes in the late 1970s. Other firms like the UK\\'s {{249}}s also struck at this time.',\n",

Because of this, it is said that her voice has a relaxing effect that has been observed in electroencephalograms taken from the {{3}}s of people listening to her singing.\\n\\nChitose Hajime was recognized as a gifted folk singer at a young age. She won many folk song competitions, released two traditional folk albums on an indie label, and was approached by many record labels. She decided to study to become a beautician instead of pursuing music. However, Hajime had severe allergic reactions to many of the chemicals used by beauticians. She withdrew from school, and seriously considered a music career.\\n\\nIn 2001, she released a self-titled mini-album on the indie label Office Augusta. The album was covers of older songs, but was so well received that Hajime was pushed to release another mini-album. In August 2001, Chitose released her second mini-album with Augusta Records entitled Kotonoha ( コトノハ, Kotonoha) . This release featured 5 original tracks. \\n\\nIn 2002 she released her first major label single on Epic Records - \"Wadatsumi no Ki\" ( ワダツミの木, \"Wadatsumi no Ki\") . It was the third highest selling single of the year behind only Hikaru Utada \\'s \" traveling \", and Ayumi Hamasaki \\'s \" H \". Three months later, she released a brand new single, \"Kimi wo Omō\" ( 君ヲ想フ, \"Kimi wo Omō\") . While also very popular, it was not nearly the success that her first single was, although it did help to cement her as a permanent artist. \\n\\nHer first major album, Hainumikaze ( ハイヌミカゼ, Hainumikaze), followed later in the year. It sold 800,000 copies, charted for 57 weeks, and was the 16th highest selling album of the year. \\n\\nShe released 3 more singles before her second major album, Nomad Soul ( ノマド・ソウル, nomado souru ), was released in 2003. Shortly after a concert tour, and the release of a live album and DVD in 2004, Hajime announced that she would be taking time away from the music scene to get married, and have a child. Her first child miscarried, but she successfully gave birth to a girl on January 20, 2005. \\n\\nShe returned to the music industry in November 2005 with the single \"Kataritsugu Koto\" ( 語り継ぐこと, \"Kataritsugu Koto\"), the ending theme for the anime BLOOD+ . The single was a hit, reaching #12 on the Oricon charts. She followed this success with her next come-back single, \"Haru no Katami\" ( 春のかたみ, \"Haru no Katami\"), the ending theme for the anime AYAKASHI - Japanese Classic Horror . This single sold 6050 copies in its first week, and remained on the charts for 7 weeks total. A third single was released before her next album. The single, \"Ao no Requiem\" ( 青のレクイエム, \"Ao no Requiem\"), was the theme song for the Studio GAGA film Hatsukoi . It featured 1 extra track, and charted for 3 weeks. The following week, Hajime released her third original major album, Hanadairo ( ハナダイロ, Hanadairo) . The album was available in both a regular edition, and a limited edition. The limited edition featured a 13th track, \"Shinda Onna no Ko\" ( 死んだ女の子, \"Shinda Onna no Ko\") with Ryuichi Sakamoto, as well as a DVD containing the music videos for \"Kataritsugu Koto\", and \"Haru no Katami\".',\n",

For example, the provinces of {{9}} and Galatia, were made part of the Empire in just this way. Also, Roman law allowed inheritance only through the male line. \\n\\nWhen Prasutagus died, his will was ignored by the Governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, and his kingdom was annexed just as if it had been conquered. To make matters worse, Roman money-lenders called in the debts which Prasutagus had borrowed during his life.\\nThe lands and property of the Iceni were confiscated and their nobles treated like slaves. \\n\\nWhen Boudica protested, Paulinus had her flogged, and her two daughters raped in public. {{11}} reports:\\n\\nChoosing a good moment, when the Governor was attacking {{12}} and another legion was in {{13}}, Boudica led the Iceni and their associates, the Trinovantes, to war.

The tribes burnt and destroyed both {{17}} ({{18}}) and Londinium and massacred all they could lay their hands on.

Watling Street was an old trackway between Canterbury and St Albans. The Romans rebuilt it their way, and took it through the Midlands into Wales. \\n\\nWhile Boudica\\'s army assaulted in Verulamium, Suetonius put together a force with his own Legio XIV Gemina, some detachments of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and any available auxiliaries. Down near {{21}}, The Prefect of Legio II Augusta, Poenius Postumus, ignored the Governor\\'s call to arms. Nonetheless the Governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men.\\n\\nThe Romans were heavily outnumbered. However, the tribes lacked manoeuvrability. They had no way to direct these numbers, which put them at a disadvantage to the Romans. The Romans were skilled at open combat, and had better equipment and discipline.

In 1904, in an essay about him, Book News Biographies said \"for the past ten years Mr. Van Zile has been known to the reading public through many short stories, novelettes and a few novels\".\\n\\nHe was born on May 2, 1863 in {{3}} to Oscar Edward Van Zile and Sarah Melinda Perry. He was a descendant of {{5}}ers who came to {{6}} in the 17th century. As a boy he read everything he could on every subject. He graduated from Trinity College in {{9}} in 1884. In 1904 the college gave him the {{10}} of {{11}}. In addition to several books and articles, he wrote a {{12}} for a {{13}}.\\n\\nIn 1887 he married Mary Bulkeley. They had a daughter, Winifred Van Zile (1902-1902). He died on May 29, 1931 of a {{14}} at his home at 439 East Fifty-first Street in {{16}}.

He found himself doodling an idea on a {{27}}. He was, {{28}}ly he later said, working out a {{29}} of a baseball diamond. On it he showed pegs indicating the positions of players and other information. Edwin Grozier, at the time Private Secretary to {{33}}, looking over his shoulder said  \"Van Zile, you get that idea patented, and I\\'ll give you $250 for your interest in it.\" He had come up with what he called a \"Bulletin Board and Base Ball Indicator.\"  He filed for a {{34}} in 1888 and it was issued in 1889. It was a major breakthrough in showing the progress of baseball games. The World newspaper placed a large version of it outside their offices for that year’s baseball championship series. It was a tremendous hit. Crowds of up to 6,000 watched to get a play-by-play view of the games.',\n",

The reef acts as the home of many {{9}} fish and other animals. Coral reefs systems are a major tourism attraction because of their beauty and color of the corals and their many associated animals.  \\n\\nPeople look at them while {{10}} and {{11}}. One example of a coral reef is in {{12}} at Pulau Tioman, off the State of Pahang.\\n\\nMost present-day coral reefs were formed after the last ice age when melting ice caused the {{14}} to rise and flood the {{15}}. This means they are less than 10,000 years old. As coral reef communities were established on the shelves, they built reefs that grew upwards, keeping pace with the rise in sea level. Reefs that did not keep pace became drowned reefs, covered by so much water that there was insufficient light for further survival.\\n\\nCoral reefs are also found in the deep sea away from the continental shelves, around {{16}}ic {{17}}s and as {{18}}s. The vast majority of these ocean coral islands are {{19}} in origin. The few exceptions have {{20}} origins where plate movements have lifted the deep ocean floor on the surface.\\n\\nCoral reefs are fragile ecosystems. Because corals need warm, sunlit water to live, they often grow close to the top of the water. Being so close to land makes them often be damaged by poisons and dirt that can come from boats and the land nearby. Dirt makes the water more cloudy, which makes the sunlight less. Poisons can bleach and kill corals. Also, they are hard for ships to see, but easy to hit, which makes ships often run into the coral, damaging both the boats and coral. Because of this, many countries are trying to lessen the kinds of building that usually happen near beaches that have coral reefs nearby, and be more careful about the boats that go around reefs.',\n",

It can be a {{7}} form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like {{8}}. The taste of chocolate is often described as {{9}} because chocolate makers usually add a lot of {{10}} and {{11}} for taste. This means that chocolate can be bad for your teeth and {{12}}. It is best to eat chocolate in moderation. \\n\\nThere are three main types of chocolate: white chocolate, {{14}}, and {{15}}. White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types, because it has more of the sweeter {{16}}s in it. White chocolate does not have any {{17}} in it. It is mostly made of {{18}}. Milk chocolate is sweet, but not as sweet as white chocolate. Milk chocolate has some cocoa. Dark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor. Dark chocolate has up to 60-85 {{19}} cocoa.\\n\\nChocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts. Some animals, like {{21}}s, become sick if they eat chocolate. People with {{22}} can also get sick from eating chocolate. Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight disease. Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of {{23}} because of polyphenol in chocolate. It is necessary to eat moderate amount of chocolate.\\n\\nMaking chocolate is a process that has many steps. First, the {{25}} beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment. Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol. Then the beans are dried and cleaned. Chocolate makers must cook the beans, and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the chocolate liquor come out of them. Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate. Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate liquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla. White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor, but only cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk and {{27}}. After these ingredients are put together, the chocolate maker is still not finished. One of the last things to be done is something called conching. Before chocolate is conched, it feels very rough in the mouth, instead of smooth. Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid. Conching for several hours makes good chocolate. The last step in making chocolate is called tempering. The chocolate is heated, and then shaken, and then cooled a few times.\\n\\nThere are a number of ingredients in chocolate. The most notable of these are {{28}} and {{29}}. These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans. In any bean, the amount of each {{30}} varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season. It takes two hours to make chocolate.\\n\\nThe cacao {{31}} was first found to be useful for its {{32}}s about two thousand years ago. Early {{33}}ns and {{34}} used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet. Only the important people could drink it. The word for \"chocolate\" in almost every language comes from its name in the {{35}} of Mexico, chocolatl.\\n\\nLater on, this drink was made sweeter and made into the {{36}} that is known today as hot chocolate. It was made popular by {{37}} {{38}}s who brought it from {{39}} to {{40}}. When chocolate was sweetened and made into {{41}}, it became a very popular treat for many {{42}}ans. At first, only the rich could afford chocolate. Now, many people enjoy it. Most cocoa today is made in {{43}}. \\n\\nCadbury chocolate in Birmingham\\n\\nCadbury\\'s as we know it today started from small beginnings in Bull Street, Birmingham. A shop was opened by John Cadbury in 1824. It did not start as a confectionery shop but sold tea and coffee and home-made drinking chocolate or cocoa which he made himself for his customers.\\n\\nIn those days cocoa and chocolate was a luxury and affordable by only the wealthy. John\\'s experiments with chocolate and a strong marketing campaign soon made him a leading trader in Birmingham. The shop did very well and became more and more popular.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Electricity is the presence and flow of {{0}}. Its best-known form is the flow of {{1}} through conductors such as {{2}} wires.\\n\\nElectricity is a form of energy that comes in positive and negative forms, that occur naturally (as in lightning), or is produced (as in generator). It is a form of {{3}} which we use to power {{4}}s and {{5}}.  When the charges are not moving, electricity is called {{6}}.  When the charges are moving they are an {{7}}, sometimes called \\'dynamic electricity\\'. {{8}} is the most known - and dangerous - kind of electricity in {{9}}, but sometimes static electricity causes things to stick together. \\n\\nElectricity can be dangerous, especially around water because water is a form of conductor. Since the nineteenth century, electricity has been used in every part of our lives. Until then, it was just a curiosity seen in a {{10}}.\\n\\nElectricity can be created if a {{11}} passes close to a metal wire. This is the method used by a {{12}}. The biggest generators are in {{13}}s.  Electricity can also be generated by combining {{14}} in a jar with two different kinds of {{15}} rods. This is the method used in a {{16}}. {{17}} is created through the friction between two materials - for instance a wool cap and a plastic ruler. This may make a {{18}}. Electricity can also be created using energy from the sun, as in {{19}} cells.    \\n\\nElectricity arrives at homes through {{20}}s from the places where it is made. It is used by {{21}}s, electric {{22}}s, etc. Many {{23}}s such as {{24}}s and electric cookers use electricity. In factories, electricity powers {{25}}s. People who deal with electricity and electrical devices in our homes and factories are called \"{{26}}s\".\\n\\nHow electricity works can be explained by {{27}}. There are two types of electric charges that push and pull on each other: positive charges and negative charges. \\n\\nElectric charges push or pull on each other if they are not touching. This is possible because each charge makes an {{28}} around itself. An electric field is an area that surrounds a charge. At each point near a charge, the electric field points in a certain direction. If a positive charge is put at that point, it will be pushed in that direction. If a negative charge is put at that point, it will be pushed in the exact opposite direction.\\n\\nIt works like {{29}}s, and in fact, electricity creates a {{30}}, in which similar charges repel each other and opposite charges attract. This means that if you put two negative close together and let them go, they would move apart. The same is true for two positive charges. But if you put a positive charge and a negative charge close together, they would pull towards each other. A short way to remember this is the phrase opposites attract, likes repel.\\n\\nAll the matter in the {{31}} is made of tiny positive and negative charges.  The positive charges are called {{32}}s, and the negative charges are called {{33}}s.  Protons are much heavier than electrons, but they both have the same amount of electric charge, except that protons are positive and electrons are negative.  Because \"opposites attract,\" protons and electrons stick together.  A few protons and electrons can form bigger particles called {{34}}s and {{35}}s.  Atoms and molecules are still very tiny.  They are too small to see. Any big object, like your finger, has more atoms and molecules in it than anyone can count. We can only {{36}} how many there are. \\n\\nBecause negative electrons and positive protons stick together to make big objects, all big objects that we can see and feel are electrically neutral. Electrically is a word meaning \"describing electricity\", and neutral is a word meaning \"balanced.\" That is why we do not feel objects pushing and pulling on us from a distance, like they would if everything was electrically charged. All big objects are electrically neutral because there is exactly the same amount of positive and negative charge in the world. We could say that the world is exactly balanced, or neutral. This seems very surprising and lucky. Scientists still do not know why this is so, even though they have been studying electricity for a long time.\\n\\nIn some materials, electrons are stuck tightly in place, while in other materials, electrons can move all around the material. Protons never move around a solid object because they are so heavy, at least compared to the electrons. A material that lets electrons move around is called a conductor. A material that keeps each electron tightly in place is called an {{37}}. Examples of conductors are copper, aluminum, silver, and gold. Examples of insulators are rubber, plastic, and wood. {{38}} is used very often as a conductor because it is a very good conductor and there is so much of it in the world. Copper is found in electrical wires. But sometimes, other materials are used.\\n\\nInside a conductor, {{39}} bounce around, but they do not keep going in one direction for long. If an electric field is set up inside the conductor, the electrons will all start to move in the direction opposite to the direction the field is pointing (because electrons are negatively charged). A battery can make an electric field inside a conductor. If both ends of a piece of wire are connected to the two ends of a battery (called the electrodes), the loop that was made is called an {{40}}. Electrons will flow around and around the circuit as long as the battery is making an electric field inside the wire. This flow of electrons around the circuit is called electric current.\\n\\nA conducting wire used to carry electric current is often wrapped in an insulator such as rubber. This is because wires that carry current are very dangerous. If a person or an animal touched a bare wire carrying current, they could get hurt or even die depending on how strong the current was. You should be careful around electrical sockets and bare wires that might be carrying current.\\n\\nIt is possible to connect an electrical device to a circuit so that electrical current will flow through a device. This current will make the device do something that we want it to do. Electrical devices can be very simple. For example, in a {{41}}, current flows through a special wire called a filament, which makes it glow. Electrical devices can also be very complicated. Electricity can be used to drive an {{42}} inside a tool like a drill or a pencil sharpener. Electricity is also used to power modern electronic devices, including [telephones], computers, and televisions.\\n\\nHere are a few terms that a person can come across when studying how electricity works. The study of electricity and how it makes electrical circuits possible is called {{43}}. There is a field of {{44}} called {{45}}, where people come up with new things using electricity. All of these terms are important for them to know.\\n\\nElectricity is mostly generated in places called {{46}}s.  Most power stations use heat to boil water into {{47}} which turns a {{48}}.  The steam engine\\'s {{49}} turns a machine called a \\'{{50}}\\'.  Coiled wires inside the Generator are made to spin in a {{51}}. This causes electricity to flow through the wires. This process is called  {{52}} . Michael Faraday discovered how to do this. \\n\\nThere are many sources of heat which can be used to generate electricity. Heat sources can be classified into two types: renewable energy resources in which the supply of heat energy never runs out and {{55}} in which the supply will be eventually used up. \\n\\nSometimes a natural flow, such as {{56}} or {{57}}, can be used directly to turn a generator so no heat is needed.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The universe is commonly defined as everything that {{0}}s. It includes all kinds of physical {{1}} and {{2}}, the {{3}}s, {{4}}s, {{5}}, and all the contents of {{6}}.\\n\\n{{7}} can use [telescopes] to look at very distant galaxies. This is how they see what the universe looked like a long time ago. This is because the light from distant parts of the universe takes a very long time to reach us. From these observations, it seems the {{8}}s and {{9}}s of the universe have not changed.\\n\\nPhysicists are currently unsure if anything existed before the Big Bang. They are also unsure whether the size of the universe is infinite.\\n\\nMany people in history had ideas to explain the universe. Most early models had the Earth at the centre of the Universe. Some ancient Greeks thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever. They thought it had a set of {{11}}s which corresponded to the fixed stars, the {{12}} and various {{13}}s. The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving {{14}}. \\n\\nOver the centuries, better observations and better ideas of gravity led to {{15}}\\'s {{16}}-centred model. This was hugely controversial at the time, and was fought long and hard by authorities of the Christian church (see {{18}} and {{19}}).\\n\\nThe invention of the [telescope] in the {{20}}, 1608, was a milestone in astronomy. By the mid-19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished. The modern optical (uses visible light) telescope is still more advanced. Meanwhile, the {{21}} dynamics ({{23}}s) showed how the Solar System worked. \\n\\nThe improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realise that the Solar System is in a {{25}} made of billions of stars, the Milky Way, and that other galaxies exist outside it, as far as we can see. Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their {{27}}s have led to much of {{28}}. Discovery of the {{29}} showed that the Universe is expanding (see {{30}}). \\n\\nThe most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the Big Bang theory. The Universe expanded from a very hot, dense phase called the Planck epoch, in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated. Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and, more generally, the Big Bang idea. Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of dark energy. Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods. This has been named {{34}}.\\n\\nJust to be clear, dark matter and energy have not been detected directly (that is why they are called \\'dark\\'). Their existence is {{35}} by {{36}} from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise.\\n\\nCurrent thinking in cosmology is that the {{37}} is 13.73 (± 0.12) billion years, and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion {{38}}s, or 8.80  {{39}}s. \\n\\nAccording to general relativity, space can get bigger faster than the speed of light, but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light. We cannot see space beyond the limitations of light (or any {{41}}).\\n\\nThe word Universe comes from the {{42}} word Univers, which comes from the {{43}} word universum. The Latin word was used by {{44}} and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern English word is used. \\n\\nA different interpretation (way to interpret) of unvorsum is \"everything rotated as one\" or \"everything rotated by one\". This refers to an early Greek model of the Universe. In that model, all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth; according to {{46}}, the rotation of the outermost sphere was responsible for the motion and change of everything within. It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the {{47}}, because careful {{48}} and physical measurements (such as the {{49}}) are required to prove otherwise.\\n\\nThe most common term for \"Universe\" among the ancient Greek philosophers from {{50}} onwards was το παν (The All), defined as all matter (το ολον) and all space (το κενον).\\n\\nThe broadest word meaning of the Universe is found in De divisione naturae by the medieval {{53}} Johannes Scotus Eriugena, who defined it as simply everything: everything that exists and everything that does not exist.\\n\\nTime is not considered in Eriugena\\'s definition; thus, his definition includes everything that exists, has existed and will exist, as well as everything that does not exist, has never existed and will never exist. This all-embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers, but something similar is in quantum physics.\\n\\nUsually the Universe is thought to be everything that exists, has existed, and will exist. This definition says that the Universe is made of two elements: {{56}} and {{57}}, together known as {{58}} or the {{59}}; and {{60}} and different forms of {{61}} and {{62}} occupying {{63}}. The two kinds of elements behave according to {{64}}s, in which we describe how the elements interact. \\n\\nA similar definition of the term Universe is everything that exists at a single moment of time, such as the present or the beginning of time, as in the sentence \"The Universe was of size 0\".\\n\\nIn {{65}}\\'s book The Physics, Aristotle divided το παν (everything) into three roughly analogous elements: matter (the stuff of which the Universe is made), form (the arrangement of that matter in space) and change (how matter is created, destroyed or altered in its properties, and similarly, how form is altered). {{66}}s were the rules governing the properties of matter, form and their changes. Later philosophers such as {{67}}, {{68}}, {{69}} and {{70}} altered or refined these divisions. For example, Averroes and Spinoza have active principles governing the Universe which act on passive elements.\\n\\nIt is possible to form {{71}}s, each existing but not able to touch, move, or change (interact with each other. An easy way to think of this is a group of separate {{72}}s, in which people living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles. According to one common terminology, each \"soap bubble\" of space-time is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular {{73}} is denoted as the Universe, just as we call our moon the {{74}}. The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the {{75}}. In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different {{76}}alities and {{77}} of {{78}}, different forms of {{79}} and {{80}}, and different {{81}}s and {{82}}s, although such possibilities are {{83}}s.\\n\\nAccording to a still-more-restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected {{84}} that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa. \\n\\nAccording to the general idea of relativity, some regions of {{86}} may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe, due to the finite {{87}} and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe would exist forever; space may expand faster than light can traverse it. \\n\\nIt is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are; yet we can never interact with them, even in principle. The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the observable universe. \\n\\nStrictly speaking, the observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space-time than an observer who remains still, so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the \\'observable universe\\' means the universe seen from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy.\\n\\nThe Universe is huge and possibly {{88}} in volume. The matter which can be seen is spread over a space at least 93 billion {{89}} across. For comparison, the diameter of a typical {{90}} is only 30,000 light-years, and the typical distance between two neighboring galaxies is only 3 million {{91}}. As an example, our Milky Way Galaxy is roughly 100,000 light years in diameter, and our nearest sister galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy, is located roughly 2.5 million light years away. There are probably more than 100 billion (10 seconds after its creation). Recent observations also suggest that the cosmological constant (Λ) is not zero and that the net mass-energy content of the universe is dominated by a dark energy and {{97}} that have not been characterized scientifically. They differ in their gravitational effects. Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the universe\\'s expansion.\\n\\nSome people think that there is more than one Universe. They think that there is a {{98}} of universes called the {{99}}. By definition, there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another.\\nThe multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it. An idea that cannot be tested is not science.',\n",

The tank is a large metal cylinder made of {{0}} or {{1}}.\\n\\nThe word Scuba is an {{2}} from  {{3}} {{4}}  {{5}}.\\n\\nIn the 1600s, a {{6}} would be lowered that had trapped air in it.  A diver would breathe that air and swim in an and out of the bell until the air became bad.\\nThen a heavy suit was made that had a hose attached to an air compressor on land.  It was difficult to swim and not get tangled, but it was safer than the diving bell.\\n\\nThe first scuba systems used a heavy diving helmet with windows.  Divers would walk on the seafloor instead of swimming.  The regulator would send air to the helmet by hand control.  {{7}} was a very famous {{8}} who developed several important parts of the scuba system and made it useful.  One part was a better regulator that only sent air when the diver breathed in.  This let the divers go farther on one tank.  It was light enough to use with fins and easily swim.  He also took many underwater movies and showed people what was under the water and why it needed to be protected.\\n\\nDivers also use {{9}} equipment.  They wear a mask to see through, a snorkel for breathing near the surface, fins on their feet to swim better, and a wetsuit to keep them warm under water because water makes you cold four times as fast as air.\\n\\nRunning out of air or getting the bends can be dangerous. So a person must take a certification class before going scuba diving. This proves that they have been trained on how to use the equipment and dive safely.  The biggest organization for certifying divers is PADI - Professional Association of Diving Instructors - but there are many others, depending on the country.  Some tourist places have a short course on certification and then lead the class in a shallow dive, all in one day.\\n\\nBecause of special dangers, there are advanced classes for things like diving in or around underwater ship wrecks, cave diving, and deep diving (more than 60 feet or 18 meters).',\n",

Iron-nickel meteorites are mostly iron often with significant nickel as well.\\n\\nMeteors sometimes hurt people and property. The {{11}} did the most damage. Large meteorite strikes may have played a part in several of the mass {{12}}s, and so indirectly on the course of {{13}}. (see {{14}}; {{15}}; {{16}})\\n\\nChondrites are stony (non-metallic) {{17}}s that are as old as the Solar System: 4.55 {{19}} years. They sometimes contain amino acids and other organic molecules.\\n\\nThey have not been modified due to {{21}} or other disturbances. They are formed when various types of dust and small grains that were present in the early solar system accreted to form primitive {{22}}s. They are the most common type of meteorite that falls to Earth: they are about 85 or 86 per cent of all meteorites. \\n\\nTheir study gives clues about the origin and age of the Solar System, the synthesis of {{24}}s, the {{25}} or the presence of water on {{26}}. Chondrites can be differentiated from iron meteorites by their low {{27}} and {{28}} content.\\n\\nAbout 8 per cent of meteorites show signs of melting and recrystallising. They look rather like {{29}} or {{30}}.\\n\\nIron meteorites are meteorites made of an {{31}}–{{32}} {{33}}. They are about 6 per cent of all meteorites. This comes from the inner cores of early small proto-planets. The iron found in iron meteorites was one of the earliest sources of usable iron,  before {{34}}s invented {{35}}. That signalled the beginning of the iron age. Iron meteorites are easily found, because native iron is rare.\\n\\nSiderolites are stony-iron meteorites that have almost equal parts of iron and {{37}}s. They are quite rare: only about 1 per cent of all meteorites are siderolites.',\n",

Lemaire thought the story of Samson and Delilah was better suited to an {{18}}. He persuaded Saint-Saëns to write an opera instead of an oratorio. \\n\\nSaint-Saëns was drawn to the story because it gave him the opportunity to compose a grand {{19}} against a rising storm. He knew {{20}}\\'s take on the story from {{21}}\\'s {{22}} for an opera on the subject (now lost), but Rameau\\'s storm was a {{23}} for the wrath of God. {{24}}\\'s Otello was nearer to what Saint-Saëns had in mind. He wrote, \"I imagined a storm that would no longer be an hors-d\\'œuvre (a tidbit eaten before a meal) but adhere to the action and become one with it.\"\\n\\nSaint-Saëns set to work in 1868. He wrote an {{25}} for Delilah, a {{26}} for Samson and Delilah, and the {{27}}. He tried them out at home. Friends weren\\'t very interested. The composer put the work aside for a time. He met {{28}} in Weimar, Germany about 1870. Liszt encouraged him to take up the project again. He promised Saint-Saëns he would stage the opera.\\n\\nIn 1873 Saint-Saëns finished the score. {{29}} staged Act 2 in a garden at Croissy. The director of the Paris Opera was present. He found the opera too {{30}}. He also thought it neglected French opera tradition. Biblical stories were not staged in France. It was considered sacrilegious. Act 1 was performed \"concert style\" in 1875. This means it was performed without costumes, scenery, or \"acting\". It was a failure.\\n\\nSaint-Saëns kept working. He published the score. He wrote a dedication to Viardot. In 1877 Liszt staged the work at the Weimar Court Theatre in Germany. It was sung in German instead of French. The opera was well received. People liked it. Paris wasn\\'t very interested, though. In 1890 the opera was staged in Rouen at composer {{31}}\\'s urging. It was staged the same year in Paris.

The first full production of Samson took place in 1909. King Edward VII of England was said to have helped get the opera staged.\\n\\nGoodwin writes that Saint-Saëns\\'s pupil and friend Gabriel Faure always said that the reason Samson and Delilah met with disinterest in France was the fact that the composer was viewed as a symphonistnot because the opera was based on a Biblical text. \"Symphonist\" was a pejorative term at the time. It was tossed about by opera and ballet fans. Samson and Delilah was also a departure from 19th century opera traditions. This was another reason for some to ignore it. It was a three-act opera rather than a standard five-act opera as laid down by Meyerbeer. The opera featured only three principal charactersSamson, Delilah, and the High Priestthus creating another departure from the norm. \\n\\nSaint-Saëns was almost an {{40}}. He did not point out a moral in this opera but let the work speak for itself. He admired the operas of Verdi. He liked the oratorios of {{41}} and {{42}}two composers whose influence is felt in the choruses of Samson. He framed the central seduction scene with the two outer acts. In contrast with Samson (strength) and the High Priest (power), Delilah is a character of seductive strength and power. She wants Samson on her sidenot for lovebut for her own vanity and sexual gratification. She puts everything she has into successfully seducing him because, if she fails, her head will be on the chopping  block.\\n\\nIn a square in Gaza, the {{43}} pray for release from slavery to the Philistines. Samson tries to lift their spirits. Abimelech taunts the Hebrews. He says his god Dagon is greater than the Hebrew god. Samson defies him. Abimelech attacks Samson with a sword. Samson disarms and kills him. The Hebrews flee. The High Priest of Dagon makes plans to use Delilah to trap Samson. \\n\\nDelilah enters with the priestesses of Dagon. She flirts with Samson. She invites him to her home in Sorek. An old Hebrew warns Samson about loving Delilah. Samson prays for God\\'s protection. Delilah and the priestesses begin to dance. Samson fights his desire for Delilah. The old Hebrew repeats his warning. As the curtain closes, Samson meets Delilah\\'s gaze. It is clear he will join her in Sorek.\\n\\nIn Sorek Delilah sings about her power over Samson. The High Priest arrives. He reports that Samson and the Hebrews have destroyed the harvest. He offers gold to Delilah to trap Samson. She refuses to take the money. She wants only revenge. Delilah vows to find the secret of Samson\\'s strength. The High Priest leaves.\\n\\nDelilah considers her chances of success. Samson arrives to say farewell. He plans to lead the Hebrew revolt.  Delilah tells Samson that she loves him. He admits that he loves her. They sing rapturously. Delilah wants to know the secret of his strength. Samson will not tell her. She weeps and runs into her house. Samson follows. She learns the secret of his strength. She calls to Philistine soldiers hiding nearby. They capture Samson and blind him.\\n\\nSamson is chained to a mill-wheel in a {{44}}. He prays for his people.

The boy leads him to the two main pillars in the temple. Samson prays for strength. He pulls down the pillars. The temple collapses. Samson is crushed with his enemies beneath the stones.\\n\\nfrom Encyclopedia Americana, 2002; volume 24, pages 185-86',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, also called Cocos Islands and Keeling Islands, is a territory of {{0}}. There are two {{1}}s and twenty-seven coral islands in the group. The {{2}}s are in the {{3}}, about one-half of the way from Australia to {{4}}. \\n\\nCaptain William Keeling was the first European to see the islands, in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the nineteenth century, when they became a possession of the Clunies-Ross Family. {{7}} were brought to work the {{8}} plantation from {{9}}, the {{10}} and East Asia by Alexander Hare who had taken part in {{11}}' takeover of {{12}} in 1811. A {{13}} merchant seaman called Captain John Clunies-Ross, who had also served under Raffles in the takeover, set up a compound and Hare's severely mistreated slaves soon escaped to work under better conditions for Clunies-Ross. \\n\\nOn {{14}} {{15}}, the islands were transferred to Australian control under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. In the 1970s, Australian government dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of AU$6,250,000, using the threat of compulsory purchase. By agreement the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. However, in 1983 the Australian government moved to dishonour this agreement, and told the former last ruler, John Clunies-Ross, that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the High Court of Australia ruled that the government could not buy Oceania House.  Instead the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be given to his shipping company, an action which contributed to his bankruptcy. John Clunies-Ross lives in exile in Perth, Australia, but his successors still live on the Cocos.\\n\\nIn 2004 there were 629 people living on the Cocos (Keeling) islands. There are about 120 Europeans on West Island and 500 Malays on Home Island.  A Cocos dialect of Malay and English are the main languages spoken and 80% of Cocos Islanders are {{16}}. India does not recognise Anglo annexation of these Cultural Indo-Indian/Indies islands as part of Australia and disputes it's status to counterbalance regional hegemonic sea power. \\n\\nThe capital of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands is West Island while the largest settlement is the village of Bantam (Home Island). Governance of the islands is based on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955\",\n",
